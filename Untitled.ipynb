       "\"Five four cool All right, well Thank you all for being here and thanks for having me as a guest at this this this meetup here and yeah I can give you a background about myself, you know how how My career has landed me to lead a developer relations team at Silicon Valley startup and I work in Minnesota, but I can tell you my journey of how I I now work for one of the hottest startups startups in Silicon Valley And I can give you my deep background and also how features can be kicked off in the beginning, you know so let's see where I where do I want to get started um yeah i'll start with my i'll start with my work history so I I joined the army National Guard before I went to college my my i've always been interested in computers and understand how computers work so when I joined The military I wanted to graduate debt free was my goal from college, I did I don't want to have any debt when I graduated so that was my primary reason for for joining the military and get some free education, so I joined the military what I was doing was a computer networking engineer I go out in the middle of nowhere shoot up to a satellite grabbing up link deploy network and programs routers and switches so very network focused and building up so you'd have like nothing you'd be out in the middle of a cornfield and there's nothing there you bring all your trucks and your tents and whatnot and your computers and Your networking stacks and you, we have to set up the base of operations and then by the end of US setting this up now you have computers and phones and whatnot So I got a lot of clearances and I had my secrets cured clans by the Department of Defense and all these networking certifications So when I went through college I tested out of some classes, because they're so boring And I was never a big fan of school but i'm a very passionate person about learning I love education, I love learning I love being creative But school was not my favorite thing to be honest and so anyways yeah so I went to I went to mankato State University just because my My family has a lot of history down there, and my grandpa was professor and my parents went there so that's where i'd family nearby So I went I went there that degree and CS basically with focus on networking security, and you know I had a background in that, and then I, my first job as an intern was working at united health group I don't know if you've heard of united health group or optum They have a really cool program it's called the technology development program so we're one of the pioneers to this this new program that they're trying to create now if you go to college anywhere in Minnesota you'll probably have these Optimum recruiters telling you all about the Program Which is a rotational program so I got in there as an intern I was a super intern I was Harry had, I had a higher clearance level than everybody in the $6 billion data centers I can go into any server rooms swap different things out figure different things And yeah I started doing networking got really bored really fast of doing that work and engineering a big giant company had the opportunity to join this sort of creative startup incubator inside this giant company called optimum and it was very Very business model focused I don't know if you know the lean methodology it's a great book if you if you haven't read that before Running lean talks about how you can create a startup and what steps you need to take so we we follow this methodology I think a great example of that would be like uber you know cars existed phones existed, it was just reimagining airbnb another great one it's reimagining the way that the business, you know, using what's out there reimagining the way a business operates And so we're doing that, from a healthcare perspective, so I was a founder in residence at this this startup incubator And then, in August 2016 we started seeing emerging technologies really disrupt different industries And this is everything from Ai technologies natural language trusts machine learning deep learning computer vision, the list of Ai stuff goes on and on how blockchain technologies Internet of Things quantum computing and graph databases And so, for coming from the networking world I lean heavy into into the into the graph space interconnected data and the more I was in this is where this is where we started to formulate the futurist academy is I was doing a lot of things where i'd take my education about blockchain or Ai natural language processing graph databases and I start to go to Community events in different schools, I went to EDEN prairie and that's where I met There was an ios developer team and that's where I met real hon anyways I was asked to come to the EDEN prairie school and give a talk about blockchain, and so we launched a cryptocurrency live in class on the test net So we talked about how blockchains work and how cryptocurrency works, but I was doing a lot of these different events, where I was engaging with different Different students in different meetups and different things, and people kept asking how can we be part of this, how can we be part of something where we're connected Community that is Constantly learning, and so the reason I wanted to also create futures camp is not only to create that house, but also for the ability to discover new passions and learn from one another, also I hated school, and so I you know I thought there's so many opportunities that you can engineer yourself if you just put your mind to it and being passionate and learning about new things, and you can engineer yourself your own opportunity that you might want to do so if you wanted to work at tesla, how do you get there, if you want to work at the neuro link project, how can you get there How can you engineer yourself into that kind of position So anyways that's how a feature set Kevin was really created was not by my thought of creating a features coming it was more based off demand of other people wanting to be part of a community that intermingled So then yeah I got I got a call from tiger graph and they're like we want you to be a technology evangelist i'm from Minnesota I have no idea all the terminology from Silicon Valley, so I was like what's the technology evangelist they're like we would just want you to do what you're doing but do it for us do meetups do events do blogs do videos do engagements help Help other developers understand the technology, and so, two years ago I jumped off of usg after working there for six and a half years and made the transition to to tiger graph and so now i've been here for for two years and training, training people up nurturing the commute I run the Community for for tiger graph we do a lot of different events and and challenges and do a lot of Community engagement a lot Open Source projects my favorite thing to do is is Share other people's projects in the Community, so if I see something cool on github or somebody reaches out, I always like to to advocate and share their blogs and get it repost it on social media But yeah that's that's a crash course in my my life and my background and networking engineer to founder and residents to building out emerging tech lab To doing a lot of Community engagement to ultimately being a developer, leaving the developer relations team here at tiger graph so Any any questions on the journey yeah go ahead I was what How is working for tech graph it's it's awesome yeah no it's it's um if you're not familiar, I mean so graph databases power pretty much everything, today you just might not know know about it And Google Google declared a blog that says things not strings if you ever want to look it up And it was their declaration of them using graph to interconnect all the data together so that uncanny ability When you're when you're browsing different things and ads pop up that's because they're doing all of these different things that are all interconnected and that could includes not only your behaviors but other people's like similar people like you and their behaviors If you look at the algorithms for netflix or HBO is a customer of ours, how you're able to recommend content that that's powered by graph under the hood of linkedin is powered by graph Facebook under the hood of pinterest even huge companies doing analytical Like way fer, for example, there's so many different applications of graph and it's weird because, not a lot of people understand that, but I think what I love about tiger graph Is that there's not many tools out there that are for scale that are make this technology available for everybody, so uber and all these companies have their own proprietary graph solutions That they home grown and built what tiger raft neo for Jay Cambridge semantics, some of them are labeled property graphs and some of them are already F graphs like star dog But what these technology companies do is enable everybody as a developer and customers and consumers, whatever you want to call them To have that power of these big giant tech companies, so my favorite part, though, is tiger graph is We feel we're far ahead of other other companies and so it's cool just to be at a company that just as sort of a leader in that space we haven't been around the longest but we definitely have the fastest technology platform so yeah other than that the people are great the jobs great I love helping people I it's it's a work hard play it play hard work hard work hard play hard anyways we do a lot of different things And leadership's great as far as giving us full I wouldn't say control but but gives us the breathing space to allow us to innovate and do the things that we want to do that really are targeted towards Whatever we're trying to drive in my in my perspective, i'm trying to grow adoption i'm trying to get more people to understand how to use the technology and grow the Community, so I do a lot of different events, so I love, a lot of things yeah I guess, I guess, one question i've asked is just from your perspective, what do you feel are the main things to take away from college, other than just learning Just just like learning the general topics that you have in your classes like what are the main things you can take advantage in that experience um so one thing I would have done differently in college if I, and one thing that they never teach you in college is they'll give you the book, but what you want to do there's two things you want to build influence and you want to build connections Those are the two things i'll get you anywhere in life So building influence is done by sharing right So if you learn something in school, besides just the school project, how can you apply what you learned and build something cool and then share it share it on github share it through share it through blogs or videos but, more importantly, how can you take, how can you amplify what you share to become so let's say you learn like a really let's say you learn how to do like I know you're doing data science and maybe you're putting a ui on top of a data science problem or something like that or how okay let's do stage maker so let's say you're doing some machine learning right you're learning to do some data science right and you build this really cool thing on stage maker, so if it was me, I would, I would not only do it for class, but I would be like Okay, I built this really cool thing i'm going to have really great documentation i'm going to do a blog made a video then i'm going to go to the stage maker Community forum, then i'm going to start posting about it, then i'm going to try to reach out to whoever's leading that community make them aware of it, and then try to drive more visibility into that so you're trying to build up like you're taking something that Okay, you could have just learned it and then took the test and then forgot about it but you're you're you're you could take it so much farther So that kind of thing will be built around a lot of relationships so there's a lot of that stuff they don't teach you in school, and I think if you do those kind of things you can You can far outpaced your peers, especially once you get to the point where you want to land your dream job you can engineer yourself into your dream job Right, so you can literally craft these things when I hire people I look at their github I look at what they're talking about what they do, like everyone could say stuff on resumes but then, if I see like a YouTube video and like blogs, and their github projects, and I can see all this things and they're not just like Oh, look at my resume cool I took this basic class whatever like I really don't care Even if you have a 4.0 i'll hire somebody that never even went to college that literally is just like out there and showing the proof in the pudding not not not somebody that just says they're good at something so anyways that's what I would do different and that's what I would encourage throughout college is building connections and building up credibility and engineering yourself, while you're doing that So, like, I understand, like large scale application databases yeah you could you could I could just share a couple things that i'm building right now that are small scale, maybe gives you some ideas Sure yeah so one, let me see if I can share my yep just give you a call to work So even even you can create something like this So of course I use tg cloud because it's free it's easy to use, so feel free to use tg cloud it's Nice because you can do a lot of different things and engage, you can you can interface with it and you don't have to say anything out But this is wait, the system, the one Let me to log into this one, this is my linkedin graph so this one, this one you guys could do even it's pretty straightforward basically what I wanted to do is, I wanted to see all the interconnections between some of my colleagues at work So I went to design schema so under the hood of linkedin as they're actually doing this, if you go to like your people, and you go to my network and you go to connections trying to find, where it says like first degree second degree and stuff But you guys know what i'm you know i'm talking about right first degrees here this first degree second degree third degree, so this means john's connected to Dan and the first degree and then Dan might have a friend, but i'm not connected to them so there's a second degree and then there's third degree, so one of the neat things you can do with this and pretty much with all All your social media is you can go to settings and privacy and then you can go to data privacy and get a copy of your data and then you can grab your connections So you can fetch it And then, what we're doing was so we had a list of like I think there's 20 other people, and we had them drop their connections, and so the data file, you can get the company, the position and person and see if you can explore ground So you know here here's a here's a bunch of different companies yeah you can just click on where's this person work This person works at whatever company that's called This is the position Alright, so and nobody else woman design magazine, so you just start crawling us there's probably more than one account manager has a role so let's see yeah so you can you can start to see different different you know different views here if i'm just manually creating crawling us, but the things I wanted to do was how can I find who's connected to who maybe by a company So I just wrote wrote some basic queries like get connections of a person, so this one, if I do See somebody I know Now, I can see who's connected to my work with Dan mccurry who's an optimum employee And then, how do I take this further one of the cool things that tiger APP has is that you can get everything as a as a rest endpoint so, then what we did was and I don't have the shame, I have it open just a second, let me pull something up to pull this up so, then I wanted to put a gui on it, because there's I don't want people to interface with the database, I just wanted them to have something super simple so i'm just going to click on this yeah graphical user interface, so we built This is this is called a read ash is the the tooling This allows you to build like a bar charts line charts pie charts and all those kind of things And, and this in a table, of course, so that queries feed into this table so it's taking json and converting it to a data frame, but then I can search, you know I can be like Okay, who all works at silence You know that that i'm connected to so who's connected to who I know that works at this company so that's like one small use case the other we're doing some other stuff if you guys are familiar discord yeah yeah we're building one one of our use cases and I don't know if I have it here Is we're basically pulling all of our discord information out then running nlp through the discord so, then we can see what people are talking about and then building a knowledge graph so we can basically And then you can put a chat Bot, on top of that, or do whatever you want or put you can put a dashboard on to it and see what you know how many times people talk about a certain let's say Python how many times that people say Python and community So you can put like analytical dashboard with your with your with your data from discord that's another sort of side project and we're doing that, beyond discord we're going into discord reddit We were doing news post so we're basically what our thought was for this little side project was can we build like What we know about ourselves, but then also what we know about other people or other communities so like competitors of analysis tool, so we can analyze other other communities, so you can go to This Community where are they talking about maybe some news post come up What were they talking about are putting this all this interconnected graph solution So that's another small one here we're making this graph specifically is pretty simplistic it's just got users and assets and tags basically we're building a clone of pinterest is what what this this this one that i'm currently on So yeah you could I mean you could you could there's so many different things, and so many different ways that you could use graph These are just some of the things that i'm actively working on right now Hopefully that answered the question but yeah you could sky's the limit for different ideas yeah another actually another resource that you guys might like This was developed by one of Our interns as a student as a freshman it's really cool because it walks you through every single step and Have you guys ever heard of plot Lee or dash i'm assuming everyone knows Python right yeah yeah Okay cool So if you know Python you'll be superstars This one And here So you can with politely politely and dash so partly as a visualization component library bar charts line charts all those kind of chart charity things dash allows you to put things into If you've heard of streamline dashes like a dashboard in tool, but a little bit more advanced, you can do a lot more different things like multi pages and and whatnot so Python based So if you know pipeline, you can build these pretty fast This one this one's like healthcare data this one's coven 19 data, this one is movie I be ID bm, I think, is what it is, or this one One of our developer advocates put a bunch of arduino sensors in his room, it was sensing different data streaming wait, maybe not this one, one of these that he was doing was streaming data from sensors But all of these have full notebooks you can literally run through this and recreate it, but then what this Quick Start guide also allows you to do is literally go see sorry there's to start the Quick Start is like just going to the basics, the adventure is more like the storytelling Put a whole story together about how how you can navigate every single step and use this this library so everything from like nav bars to sidebars and whatnot so i'll drop this into the chat but the cool thing about visualization ones is these usually resonate pretty well on like your linkedin and whatnot every time I posted I get like 200 300 likes a lot of people like visualization stuff so what i'll do sometimes is i'll create like an APP and then i'll take a video of it and they'll convert it to a gift and then put it into a linkedin to share Well, what is the name of that Google blog posts, you said that like is like things strings Oh things not strings Okay okay yeah I can you want me to share have an old back if maybe for those people that aren't familiar with Some of the things So I do a lot of presentations and so I have a lot of these decks So I think there's an interesting one yeah I can start here so here's a bunch of different like graph use cases and he's have different people are using us so like Jaguar Land Rover is really tracing their whole supply chain You know let's say a ship gets stuck in a canal, what does that impact on all the different parts and things across all of our products and services You have like wish COM that's looking at transaction history You have networking operationally you have everything from like deep link analytics so doing multi hops tracing that's another thing like doing doing deep transactional traces A lot of people aren't using a tie graph for the cool one that, I mean knowledge graphs are pretty that's like Google, you know search knowledge graphs that's that's pretty traditional the coolest one that's not listed on here, let me get seeping into it So, most of the customers have like this, but these are powered by The powered by a graph analytics oh yeah here, this might be helpful for some people So, like This is this is basically what that sample project was doing so, I have a bunch of connections, if you had your all your connections interconnected, this is what it look like, if you visualize sell your stuff so that's really what's under the hood And this was just me breaking it Okay, if I was going to break build linkedin graph How would I deconstruct it, these are all the different components, so if you start thinking like graph this is how I look At these different things, and then here's the part that we just talked about having first degree second degree third degree connections and then you run different algorithms that create fields, so a lot of different social social Social platforms do stuff like this This is going into another one, so how to do recommendation engines it's using cosine similarity algorithms Everything you do is tracked everything you do, as far as a click hover over how long you're on a page All these different things are metrics that you're that you can store into your Meta graph and you can do you can use to to create a product recommendations, of course, we talked about Google and things not strings blog 2015 pretty sure I think that's when it came out that there may be most famous algorithms called page rank So pagerank is just calculating the influence score From vertex vertex I think now they change their their algorithm of how they derive the content But that's what they used to use, and that was based off Larry page, this is my favorite one and coolest one is they're doing real real real time transaction energy loads so they're like analyzing the integrated system at in real time and to redistribute or like Reporting on all these different you know substations to this, and this, and so they can recalibrate you know what's what's happening in real time across the energy grid system which I think is critical, this is the supply chain back thinking about Land Rover Jaguar Land Rover so you have You know suppliers parts features and cars, so you might have features that are tied to multiple different parts, you know what happens if this part doesn't get somewhere because of that, what are the, what are the cut conversations effects from that These are, this is more like anti resolution fraud so you're looking at you know the users with maybe the same IP same same address maybe they try to log into a different account but they're at the same IP you can track all those different things and do traces This one's really cool for into machine learning Ai, how can you do graph based future generation, so you know traditional features, you have the tabular structure, you can look at the structure of the data and the interconnectedness of the data to to drive new feature or new features, they can use in your machine learning algorithm Know what's the difference between like a good phone and a bad phone in this yeah yeah so you know this, this is actually implementation at China mobile Have you ever had do you have an iPhone that says spam, sometimes it pops up yeah it's like scam likely or something like that yeah so what that that's doing right here that's that's basically what it is it's popping that button up and doing it based off these features so The bad phone gets a lot of rejections like people don't answer just rejected right when it's so that's one thing, the number of callbacks nobody's calling back that phone so bad phone if there's a short call duration, so you can pick up in these like Maybe it's some automated message usually then then people hang up right away so there's all of these characteristics about Bad phone even average distance so like this phone isn't kindness one that's kindness one now let's go to the other side You have a good phone maybe this is uconn your mom your mom's Klein your dad your dad's calling your aunt or whatever you know there's these interconnection of groups of phone calls going on there's also long durations of calls there's also numerous calls, you probably call your mom or dad grandpa a lot of different times and usually they have connections and there's A stable group of like phone numbers yours calling So these are these are features that I think there was like 250 features that they generated I don't know how many of them, they use but yeah, this is a deep link And you know how you you weren't able to download the data for that linkedin you're able to just like go in and download, are there any other data sources were like just for different applications where you could just go and get that um yeah there's You can comfort pretty much anything that's in tabular format to to to graph format, so one way, I would, if you're if you're interested or thinking about doing that is you can go to the learning sessions that are going on right now the fourth one is just about to come out So if you go tiger graph i'd watch these two videos because my my coworker is putting together for a brand new like if you're brand new to tiger graph how to start thinking about graph It would be part one of this graph one on one so it's just just came out recently in Part Two part three, is coming out tomorrow But it's taking somebody from the mindset of I have never heard of graph and now I have some tabular data that I want to explore so whatever that tabular data is How do I start to think and graph and interconnect that in graph and how do I derive what I want to drive out of it so that's that's what I would recommend is watching this part one and part two Okay But yeah so like in the past we've had some interns that wanted to engineer themselves into working at One of our customers places, so you did a lot of projects that were pertaining to finance of fraud, and so, you know as as an intern he created all these different Open Source projects blogs and videos and then he Basically, went to the hiring manager at this this bank and said They were there recruiting actively at the time and said yeah i'd love to work with you and and then they said yeah we really want you, and then he was negotiating his salary as an intern to basically double his salary Because he had all the proof it wasn't like he said Oh, I worked on paragraph on his resume it was literally like Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so you know he engineered himself into that that kind of position but that's what you could do as well, so like if you wanted to work at tesla or work at wherever How would you engineer yourself into to be in that position, and you might need somebody that can help guide you or be a mentor as well yeah I think that's an interesting concept, just like with the engineering yourself that you can it's not like you can just start off with nothing and still just do different things to build yourself up in that way yeah yeah you just you just ask yourself, you try to figure out like where where you can provide the most like, how can you how can you demonstrate that you can provide value in that perspective space that you want to be in And then it's all about building up that and then driving that awareness so like maybe hopefully it maybe they even reach out because they see that you became an influencer in that space, because you were doing a bunch of a bunch of things along that journey to build that influence, maybe I don't know bank people go to a specific meetup and there you know you start to go and short hair stuff there and This VP of this executive bank is at that meetup and they saw your presentation, they want to give you a job now so it's just about putting yourself out there and engineering yourself and different positions cool Do you guys have any other questions yeah i'm Danny and I was wondering like you keep saying How do I, like Well, what makes you have to you have to ask yourself what makes you passionate you know what what what excites you what kind of things are of interest to you so like let's say I love to play virtual reality, I like to do virtual out of games, or something like that You know, and I want to be a virtual I like I want to work at oculus you know how can I engineer my projects and different things and add a unique perspective that maybe they're not thinking about and then, how do I get in front of that community so when you want to like So if I was doing vr ar I might do some different hackathons and then I might share what I did, and then tag oculus and stuff and then go to their community and share it try to find key influencers maybe even my local area Even even been to the point where i'm going to be like I find somebody at oculus that lives in Minnesota and I connect with them on linkedin and say hey i'd love to go and grab a cup of coffee, you know, so you can you can you can do all these Active things not and and try to build that up versus being like Oh, I always wanted to work at oculus go through school and then you And then you got like oh I got my resume here you go and they'd be like I don't care about you, I don't know who you are you're just another resume like, how do you how do you not be that so like I guarantee you if, like If you wanted to work at tiger, if you want to work at whatever company if you're doing all those different things they're going to be taking notice It wasn't me who offered a job, to share it was our CEO and our CEO is like look at this person creating all this stuff because she was sharing all this cool things on linkedin social media was in the forums, creating all these different things doing hackathons Vance that the the CEO said hey, we need to hire this person I said All right, let's do it, you know and so she got a job right so that's that's what you need to do is is think through that and they don't teach you at that school, at least not the school, I went to You did the vr game But I don't really have like a vr want to do something What I said just if you don't know what you want to do yeah um so one thing I would do is maybe start to explore like a kid so let's go back to oculus I have no idea anything about their Community so i'm just making all this stuff up I will start to get like a deep dive into their Community what's resonating what are some like new product Maybe even not start to think of like what are their new product releases and might, might I might start targeting like Building a how to video with this new feature that they just released because that's always going to be hot like they're trying to get out the new features And then i'd start to get my presence known and then I would start to just explore different things and come up with unique things in that space so maybe like Okay, how do you do, even if you wanted to combine air and graph, how do you do like So we're talking to unity, right now, and how do we do, how do you do analytics on all the actions and behaviors and People and users and stuff like that all that data is stored into a big graph and then you can run all the analytics that you went on to it so maybe you do something unique like that I do include vr Video games with with analytics are you know you have to you have to just try to like feel it out go to you have to first go out there and try to explore And then see where what what interests you or what what yeah but but a good way, though, is is if there's new features that come out and you start being the first one to shirt like share how to do stuff with those features that company is going to take notice, you know that's that's one thing you could do huh yeah yeah I mean you have to really put your put yourself out there, since not asking simple in the way i've always given yeah always be like give give give give and people are going to start taking notice of it but you're given like strategic like you have a reason why you're doing it Thank you yeah Any last minute questions would be are correct me No, I don't work at a vr company I work at a graph database company name is here Oh, I was just giving I was just gonna example, so we were talking about how to engineer yourself and I just took a random a random company and was walking through how I would engineer myself and if I was going after that perspective john or role or company I got confused for a second Sorry I just heard that example You could do that for any example, though The big bank healthcare company, you know just engineer yourself doing strategic things to put your put yourself out there and getting visibility Oh, I have like I kind of have an interesting question, what do you think, or what do you think are the next like big upcoming technologies that you feel I don't feel like are still pretty new but there they have like a huge potential to just expanded become like pop things in CS See yes um well yeah they I mean quantum is definitely like the fringe of possible and impossible I think they know if they can never figure out quantum to work at scale That would be a pretty interesting, one that would have ripple effects across many industries, you know what if you had quantum processors for cryptocurrency or quantum whatever processors for math equations and everybody can have those at home Oh, one of the I guess it's not really a technology but it's an interesting it's an interesting thought exercises there's a I don't know the exact number, but like billions at least a billion, I think, or more of people don't have Internet right now right there's just not the infrastructure, the network spacex is coming out my parents have spacex at their house, so they just meld know are shooting up to sound like a 200 megs Now if everyone has Internet, what are the, what are the, what are the conversations of that how am I market shifts happen that might be That might be an interesting exercise but yeah graph that everyone's looking for different ways to do analytics in the grass face graph neural nets are getting pretty popular dnn there's all there's every day there's a new gbt three new you know new language models and stuff like that, so one shot learning language models, I think there's always going to be a need for analytics there's not enough data graph data scientist that's a short ever there's a lot of Python developers, but you know people that know know how to do these Different data structures um yeah I would say I would say Another one would be Digital twin is sort of a weird one in the sense that they're trying to Do predictions about different things based off of other things, and so, if you look up digital trend twin you might find a lot of different things, but digital twin in the sense of users user applications, so that could be into recommendation engines Digital twins in the sense of like medical means, how can you how can you find somebody that's super similar to yourself and then You can make that better drug recommendations or you can run different analytics But yeah blockchain technology is still have a long ways to go they're pretty pretty new Then there's a there's there's a lot of different ones, I would just I would, if I was you i'd follow gartner The emerging trends and that changes every so that's when we were working at this emerging tech working on quantum Ai de de de de de we're following the gartner emerging trends so look up that it's called the hype cycle and i'll show you all the new things on the cusp of possibilities Oh Okay, I never heard of that yeah right chicken up like this yeah gartner and look at here i'll just share it So this is this where I would go to like So it looks like This thing So these are the emerging technologies Oh, and F tease Ai driven augmentation quantum machine learning So we can go back and see what the previous ones where it's a little hard to see carbon based trends transitions bring your own identity as citizen point digital twin here's digital twin they're talking about that yeah so you can you can start to see data fabrics The gardener has a lot of great information 2009 they're talking about five g still But this is a great place to to look at the cusp of nascar 3D printing flying a time as cars say that's more than 10 years from now Low earth orbit satellites systems there, we do not the spacex so it was that one five years, I think that that that emerged a little bit earlier So yeah that's what I would look at and follow those reports partners really good at submitting those on what's what's new Are you still working on that jarvis thing I haven't I haven't for a while, actually, it was talking to a university that they wanted to incorporate graph and virtual reality like to walk through like the Meta an And I was suggested doing the jarvis project with them, but I haven't had enough resources to actually build my own jarvis type project, because the ultimate goal would be like, just as you were talking to jarvis You could use alexa and then maybe some like virtual reality on mentation who like walk through information and stuff Just never had the chance to to to focus on it so but, hopefully, hopefully, I can propose this idea to this university I think it's an Ohio That they'll have a bunch of students that could work on building something along that lines because and will just help guide them mentor them along MySpace because that's what she wants to do something vr with graph so that was pretty cool Any other any other questions guys any questions audience No, I think we're good yeah thanks for thanks for coming here and spending the time just talk about those then provide your your thoughts and insights on things yeah yeah and feel free to Ping me on discord if you want like hey i'm thinking about doing this, could you have do you have any advice, how to approach that You know, or if you have a dream job and you want us to somebody else to drift off of how you can successfully get yourself in there, let me know more than willing to to help coach or mentor Oh, I actually had a question, so I was thinking about doing like a graph database it's like trying to model like something about students like sleep better or something But I wasn't really sure how to go about that, but I was just thinking like for like I don't know how I would like collect data or anything like that, so I wanted to ask you, like how, how do you like get data for like these kind of projects yeah sometimes on kaggle we've done fitbit data with tiger graph at my previous company adopt them and basically we just asked everyone to share their fitbit data, just like you would share your linkedin data And so we did a data dump of their their data That my coworker is actually the primary The my coworkers the primary driver of that that initiative and that product, so if that's something that really interests you i'll tell them to to to chat with you, and he can tell you all about how to structure it up for fitbit data yeah I don't think there's many blogs on that either So if you create some can share it with everybody right for like fitbit data yeah I haven't I haven't seen I he created an iot you create an iot graph on if you go to YouTube and then go to tie graph and then look up iot I think there's some iot based stuff he created And, but it was it was more arm, you know, like whether or is more like temperature and humidity sensing but I mean the same concept, you know streaming data yeah yeah I think all Right, thank you All right, it's good to see you guys \""

       "\"Five four. cool. All right, well. Thank you all for being here and thanks for having me as a guest at this this this meetup here and yeah I can give you a background about myself, you know how how. My career has landed me to lead a developer relations team at Silicon Valley startup and I work in Minnesota, but I can tell you my journey of how I I now work for one of the hottest startups startups in Silicon Valley. And I can give you my deep background and also how features can be kicked off in the beginning, you know so let's see where I where do I want to get started um. yeah i'll start with my i'll start with my work history so. I I joined the army National Guard before I went to college my my i've always been interested in computers and understand how computers work so when I joined. The military I wanted to graduate debt free was my goal from college, I did I don't want to have any debt when I graduated so that was my primary reason for for joining the military and. get some free education, so I joined the military what I was doing was a computer networking engineer I go out in the middle of nowhere shoot up to a satellite grabbing up link deploy network and programs routers and switches so very network focused. and building up so you'd have like nothing you'd be out in the middle of a cornfield and there's nothing there you bring all your trucks and your tents and whatnot and your computers and. Your networking stacks and you, we have to set up the base of operations and then by the end of US setting this up now you have computers and phones and whatnot. So I got a lot of clearances and I had my secrets cured clans by the Department of Defense and all these networking certifications So when I went through college I tested out of some classes, because they're so boring. And I was never a big fan of school but i'm a very passionate person about learning I love education, I love learning I love being creative. But school was not my favorite thing to be honest and so anyways yeah so I went to I went to mankato State University just because my My family has a lot of history down there, and my grandpa was professor and my parents went there so that's where i'd family nearby. So I went I went there that degree and CS basically with focus on networking security, and you know I had a background in that, and then I, my first job as an intern was working at united health group. I don't know if you've heard of united health group or optum. They have a really cool program it's called the technology development program so we're one of the pioneers to this this new program that they're trying to create now if you go to college anywhere in Minnesota you'll probably have these. Optimum recruiters telling you all about the Program. Which is a rotational program so I got in there as an intern I was a super intern I was. Harry had, I had a higher clearance level than everybody in the $6 billion data centers I can go into any server rooms swap different things out figure different things. And yeah I started doing networking got really bored really fast of doing that work and engineering a big giant company had the opportunity to. join this sort of creative startup incubator inside this giant company called optimum and it was very. Very business model focused I don't know if you know the lean methodology it's a great book if you if you haven't read that before. Running lean talks about how you can create a startup and what steps you need to take so we we follow this methodology. I think a great example of that would be like uber you know cars existed phones existed, it was just reimagining airbnb another great one. it's reimagining the way that the business, you know, using what's out there reimagining the way a business operates. And so we're doing that, from a healthcare perspective, so I was a founder in residence at this this startup incubator. And then, in August 2016 we started seeing emerging technologies really disrupt different industries. And this is everything from Ai technologies natural language trusts machine learning deep learning computer vision, the list of Ai stuff goes on and on how blockchain technologies Internet of Things quantum computing and graph databases. And so, for coming from the networking world I lean heavy into into the into the graph space interconnected data and the more I was in this is where this is where we started to. formulate the futurist academy is I was doing a lot of things where i'd take my education about blockchain or Ai natural language processing. graph databases and I start to go to Community events in different schools, I went to EDEN prairie and that's where I met. There was an ios developer team and that's where I met real hon anyways I was asked to come to the EDEN prairie school and give a talk about blockchain, and so we launched a cryptocurrency live in class on the test net. So we talked about how blockchains work and how cryptocurrency works, but I was doing a lot of these different events, where I was engaging with different. Different students in different meetups and different things, and people kept asking how can we be part of this, how can we be part of something where we're connected Community that is. Constantly learning, and so the reason I wanted to also create futures camp is not only to create that house, but also for the ability. to discover new passions and learn from one another, also I hated school, and so I you know I thought. there's so many opportunities that you can engineer yourself if you just put your mind to it and being. passionate and learning about new things, and you can engineer yourself your own opportunity that you might want to do so if you wanted to work at tesla, how do you get there, if you want to work at the neuro link project, how can you get there. How can you engineer yourself into that kind of position. So anyways that's how a feature set Kevin was really created was not by my thought of creating a features coming it was more based off demand of other people wanting to be part of a community that intermingled. So then yeah I got I got a call from tiger graph and they're like we want you to be a technology evangelist i'm from Minnesota I have no idea all the terminology from. Silicon Valley, so I was like what's the technology evangelist they're like we would just want you to do what you're doing but do it for us do meetups do events do blogs do videos do engagements help. Help other developers understand the technology, and so, two years ago I jumped off of usg after working there for six and a half years. and made the transition to to tiger graph and so now i've been here for for two years and training, training people up nurturing the commute I run the Community for for tiger graph we do a lot of different events and. and challenges and do a lot of Community engagement a lot Open Source projects my favorite thing to do is is. Share other people's projects in the Community, so if I see something cool on github or somebody reaches out, I always like to to advocate and share their blogs and get it repost it on social media. But yeah that's that's a crash course in my my life and my background and networking engineer to founder and residents to building out emerging tech lab. To doing a lot of Community engagement to ultimately being a developer, leaving the developer relations team here at tiger graph so. Any any questions on the journey. yeah go ahead. I was what. How is working for tech graph it's it's awesome. yeah no it's it's um if you're not familiar, I mean so graph databases power pretty much everything, today you just might not know know about it. And Google Google declared a blog that says things not strings if you ever want to look it up. And it was their declaration of them using graph to interconnect all the data together so that uncanny ability. When you're when you're browsing different things and ads pop up. that's because they're doing all of these different things that are all interconnected and that could includes not only your behaviors but other people's like similar people like you and their behaviors. If you look at the algorithms for netflix or HBO is a customer of ours, how you're able to recommend content that that's powered by graph under the hood of linkedin is powered by graph Facebook under the hood of pinterest even huge companies doing analytical. Like way fer, for example, there's so many different applications of graph and it's weird because, not a lot of people understand that, but I think what I love about tiger graph. Is that there's not many tools out there that are for scale that are make this technology available for everybody, so uber and all these companies have their own proprietary graph solutions. That they home grown and built what tiger raft neo for Jay Cambridge semantics, some of them are labeled property graphs and some of them are already F graphs like star dog. But what these technology companies do is enable everybody as a developer and customers and consumers, whatever you want to call them. To have that power of these big giant tech companies, so my favorite part, though, is tiger graph is. We feel we're far ahead of other other companies and so it's cool just to be at a company that just as sort of a leader in that space we haven't been around the longest but we definitely have the fastest technology platform so. yeah other than that the people are great the jobs great I love helping people I it's it's a work hard play it play hard. work hard work hard play hard anyways we do a lot of different things. And leadership's great as far as giving us full. I wouldn't say control but but gives us the breathing space to allow us to innovate and do the things that we want to do that really are targeted towards. Whatever we're trying to drive in my in my perspective, i'm trying to grow adoption i'm trying to get more people to understand how to use the technology. and grow the Community, so I do a lot of different events, so I love, a lot of things yeah. I guess, I guess, one question i've asked is just from your perspective, what do you feel are the main things to take away from college, other than just learning. Just just like learning the general topics that you have in your classes like what are the main things you can take advantage in that experience. um so one thing I would have done differently in college if I, and one thing that they never teach you in college is. they'll give you the book, but what you want to do there's two things you want to build influence and you want to build connections Those are the two things i'll get you anywhere in life. So building influence is done by sharing right So if you learn something in school, besides just the school project, how can you apply what you learned and build something cool and then share it share it on github share it through. share it through blogs or videos but, more importantly, how can you take, how can you amplify what you share to become so let's say you learn like a really. let's say you learn how to do like. I know you're doing data science and maybe you're putting a ui on top of a data science problem or something like that or how okay let's do stage maker so let's say you're doing some machine learning right. you're learning to do some data science right and you build this really cool thing on stage maker, so if it was me, I would, I would not only do it for class, but I would be like. Okay, I built this really cool. thing i'm going to have really great documentation i'm going to do a blog made a video then i'm going to go to the stage maker Community forum, then i'm going to start posting about it, then i'm going to try to reach out to whoever's leading that community. make them aware of it, and then try to drive more visibility into that so you're trying to build up like. you're taking something that Okay, you could have just learned it and then took the test and then forgot about it but you're you're you're you could take it so much farther. So that kind of thing will be built around a lot of relationships so there's a lot of that stuff they don't teach you in school, and I think if you do those kind of things you can. You can far outpaced your peers, especially once you get to the point where you want to land your dream job you can engineer yourself into your dream job. Right, so you can literally craft these things when I hire people. I look at their github I look at what they're talking about what they do, like everyone could say stuff on resumes but then, if I see like a YouTube video and like blogs, and their github projects, and I can see all this things and they're not just like. Oh, look at my resume cool I took this basic class whatever like I really don't care. Even if you have a 4.0 i'll hire somebody that never even went to college that literally is just like out there and showing the proof in the pudding not not not somebody that just says they're good at something so anyways. that's what I would do different and that's what I would encourage throughout college is building connections and building up credibility and engineering yourself, while you're doing that. So, like, I understand, like. large scale application. databases. yeah you could you could I could just share a couple things that i'm building right now that are small scale, maybe gives you some ideas. Sure yeah so one, let me see if I can share my. yep just give you a call to work. So even even you can create something like this. So of course I use tg cloud because it's free it's easy to use, so feel free to use tg cloud it's Nice because you can do a lot of different things and engage, you can you can interface with it and you don't have to say anything out. But this is wait, the system, the one. Let me to. log into this one, this is my linkedin graph so this one, this one you guys could do even it's pretty straightforward basically what I wanted to do is, I wanted to see all the interconnections between some of my colleagues at work. So I went to design schema so under the hood of linkedin as they're actually doing this, if you go to like your people, and you go to my network and you go to connections. trying to find, where it says like first degree second degree and stuff. But you guys know what i'm you know i'm talking about right first degrees here this first degree second degree third degree, so this means john's connected to. Dan and the first degree and then Dan might have a friend, but i'm not connected to them so there's a second degree and then there's third degree, so one of the neat things you can do with this and pretty much with all. All your social media is you can go to settings and privacy and then you can go to data privacy and get a copy of your data and then you can grab your connections. So you can fetch it. And then, what we're doing was so we had a list of like I think there's 20 other people, and we had them drop their connections, and so the data file, you can get the company, the position and person and see if you can explore ground. So you know here here's a here's a bunch of different companies yeah you can just click on where's this person work. This person works at whatever company that's called. This is the position. Alright, so and nobody else woman design magazine, so you just start crawling us there's probably more than one account manager has a role so let's see. yeah so you can you can start to see different different you know different views here if i'm just manually creating. crawling us, but the things I wanted to do was how can I find who's connected to who maybe by a company. So I just wrote wrote some basic queries like get connections of a person, so this one, if I do. See somebody I know. Now, I can see who's connected to my work with Dan mccurry who's an optimum employee. And then, how do I take this further one of the cool things that tiger APP has is that you can get everything as a as a rest endpoint so, then what we did was and I don't have the shame, I have it open just a second, let me pull something up. to pull this up so, then I wanted to put a gui on it, because there's I don't want people to interface with the database, I just wanted them to have something. super simple so i'm just going to click on this. yeah graphical user interface, so we built. This is this is called a read ash is the the tooling This allows you to build like a bar charts line charts pie charts and all those kind of things. And, and this in a table, of course, so that queries feed into this table so it's taking json and converting it to a data frame, but then I can search, you know I can be like Okay, who all works at silence. You know that that i'm connected to so who's connected to who I know that works at this company so that's like one small use case the other we're doing some other stuff if you guys are familiar discord. yeah yeah we're building one one of our use cases and I don't know if I have it here. Is we're basically pulling all of our discord information out then running nlp through the discord so, then we can see what people are talking about and then building a knowledge graph so we can basically. And then you can put a chat Bot, on top of that, or do whatever you want or put you can put a dashboard on to it and see what you know how many times people talk about a certain let's say Python how many times that people say Python and community. So you can put like analytical dashboard with your with your with your data from discord that's another sort of side project and we're doing that, beyond discord we're going into discord reddit. We were doing news post so we're basically what our thought was for this little side project was can we build like. What we know about ourselves, but then also what we know about other people or other communities so like competitors of analysis tool, so we can analyze other other communities, so you can go to. This Community where are they talking about maybe some news post come up What were they talking about are putting this all this interconnected graph solution. So that's another small one here we're making this graph specifically is pretty simplistic it's just got users and assets and tags basically we're building a clone of pinterest is what what this this this one that i'm currently on. So yeah you could I mean you could you could there's so many different things, and so many different ways that you could use graph. These are just some of the things that i'm actively working on right now. Hopefully that answered the question but yeah you could sky's the limit for different ideas. yeah another actually another resource that you guys might like. This was developed by one of. Our interns as a student as a freshman. it's really cool because it walks you through every single step and. Have you guys ever heard of plot Lee or dash i'm assuming everyone knows Python right. yeah yeah. Okay cool So if you know Python you'll be superstars. This one. And here. So you can with politely politely and dash so partly as a visualization component library bar charts line charts all those kind of chart charity things. dash allows you to put things into. If you've heard of streamline dashes like a dashboard in tool, but a little bit more advanced, you can do a lot more different things like multi pages and and whatnot so Python based So if you know pipeline, you can build these pretty fast. This one this one's like healthcare data this one's coven 19 data, this one is movie I be ID bm, I think, is what it is, or this one. One of our developer advocates put a bunch of arduino sensors in his room, it was sensing different data streaming wait, maybe not this one, one of these that he was doing was streaming data from sensors. But all of these have full notebooks you can literally run through this and recreate it, but then what this Quick Start guide also allows you to do. is literally go see sorry there's to start the Quick Start is like just going to the basics, the adventure is more like the storytelling. Put a whole story together about how how you can navigate every single step and use this this library so everything from like nav bars to sidebars and whatnot so i'll drop this into the. chat but the cool thing about visualization ones is these usually resonate pretty well on like your linkedin and whatnot every time I posted I get like. 200 300 likes a lot of people like visualization stuff so what i'll do sometimes is i'll create like an APP and then i'll take a video of it and they'll convert it to a gift and then put it into a linkedin to share. Well, what is the name of that Google blog posts, you said that like is like things strings. Oh things not strings. Okay okay. yeah. I can you want me to share have an old back if maybe for those people that aren't familiar with. Some of the things. So I do a lot of presentations and so I have a lot of these decks. So I think there's an interesting one. yeah I can start here so here's a bunch of different like graph use cases and he's have different people are using us so like Jaguar Land Rover is really tracing their whole supply chain. You know let's say a ship gets stuck in a canal, what does that impact on all the different parts and things across all of our products and services. You have like wish COM that's looking at transaction history. You have networking operationally you have everything from like deep link analytics so doing multi hops tracing that's another thing like doing doing deep transactional traces. A lot of people aren't using a tie graph for the cool one that, I mean knowledge graphs are pretty that's like Google, you know search knowledge graphs that's that's pretty traditional the coolest one that's not listed on here, let me get seeping into it. So, most of the customers have like this, but these are powered by. The powered by a. graph analytics oh yeah here, this might be helpful for some people. So, like. This is this is basically what that sample project was doing so, I have a bunch of connections, if you had your all your connections interconnected, this is what it look like, if you visualize sell your stuff so that's really what's under the hood. And this was just me breaking it Okay, if I was going to break build linkedin graph How would I deconstruct it, these are all the different components, so if you start thinking like graph this is how I look. At these different things, and then here's the part that we just talked about having first degree second degree third degree connections and then you run different algorithms that create fields, so a lot of different social social. Social platforms do stuff like this. This is going into another one, so how to do recommendation engines it's using cosine similarity algorithms. Everything you do is tracked everything you do, as far as a click hover over how long you're on a page. All these different things are metrics that you're that you can store into your Meta graph and you can do you can use to to create a product recommendations, of course, we talked about. Google and things not strings blog 2015 pretty sure I think that's when it came out that there may be most famous algorithms called page rank. So pagerank is just calculating the influence score. From vertex vertex I think now they change their their algorithm of how they derive the content. But that's what they used to use, and that was based off Larry page, this is my favorite one and coolest one is they're doing real real real time. transaction energy loads so they're like analyzing the integrated system at in real time and to redistribute or like. Reporting on all these different you know substations to this, and this, and so they can recalibrate you know what's what's happening in real time across the energy grid system. which I think is critical, this is the supply chain back thinking about Land Rover Jaguar Land Rover so you have. You know suppliers parts features and cars, so you might have features that are tied to multiple different parts, you know what happens if this part doesn't get somewhere because of that, what are the, what are the cut conversations effects from that. These are, this is more like anti resolution fraud so you're looking at you know the users with maybe the same IP same same address maybe they try to log into a different account but they're at the same IP you can track all those different things and do traces. This one's really cool for into machine learning Ai, how can you do. graph based future generation, so you know traditional features, you have the tabular structure, you can look at the structure of the data and the interconnectedness of the data to to drive new feature or new features, they can use in your machine learning algorithm. Know what's the difference between like a good phone and a bad phone in this. yeah yeah so you know this, this is actually implementation at China mobile Have you ever had do you have an iPhone that says spam, sometimes it pops up. yeah it's like scam likely or something like that. yeah so what that that's doing right here that's that's basically what it is it's popping that button up and doing it based off these features so. The bad phone gets a lot of rejections like people don't answer just rejected right when it's so that's one thing, the number of callbacks nobody's calling back that phone so bad phone if there's a short call duration, so you can pick up in these like. Maybe it's some automated message usually then then people hang up right away so there's all of these characteristics about. Bad phone even average distance so like this phone isn't kindness one that's kindness one now let's go to the other side. You have a good phone maybe this is uconn your mom your mom's Klein your dad your dad's calling your. aunt or whatever you know there's these interconnection of groups of phone calls going on there's also long durations of calls there's also numerous calls, you probably call your mom or dad grandpa a lot of different times and usually they have connections and there's. A stable group of like phone numbers yours calling So these are these are features that I think there was like 250 features that they generated I don't know how many of them, they use but. yeah, this is a deep link. And you know how you you weren't able to download the data for that linkedin you're able to just like go in and download, are there any other data sources were like just for different applications where you could just go and get that. um yeah there's. You can comfort pretty much anything that's in tabular format to to to graph format, so one way, I would, if you're if you're interested or thinking about doing that is you. can go to the learning sessions that are going on right now the fourth one is just about to come out. So if you go tiger graph i'd watch these two videos because my my coworker is putting together for a brand new like if you're brand new to tiger graph how to start thinking about graph. It would be part one of this graph one on one so it's just just came out recently in Part Two part three, is coming out tomorrow. But it's taking somebody from the mindset of I have never heard of graph and now I have some tabular data that I want to explore so whatever that tabular data is. How do I start to think and graph and interconnect that in graph and how do I derive what I want to drive out of it so that's that's what I would recommend is watching this part one and part two. Okay. But yeah so like in the past we've had some interns that wanted to engineer themselves into working at. One of our customers places, so you did a lot of projects that were pertaining to finance of fraud, and so, you know as as an intern he created all these different Open Source projects blogs and videos and then he. Basically, went to the hiring manager at this this bank and said. They were there recruiting actively at the time and said yeah i'd love to work with you and and then they said yeah we really want you, and then he was negotiating his salary as an intern to basically double his salary. Because he had all the proof it wasn't like he said Oh, I worked on paragraph on his resume it was literally like. Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so you know he engineered himself into that that kind of position but that's what you could do as well, so like if you wanted to. work at tesla or work at wherever How would you engineer yourself into to be in that position, and you might need somebody that can help guide you or be a mentor as well. yeah I think that's an interesting concept, just like with the engineering yourself that you can it's not like you can just start off with nothing and still just do different things to build yourself up in that way. yeah yeah you just you just ask yourself, you try to figure out like where where you can. provide the most like, how can you how can you demonstrate that you can provide value in that perspective space that you want to be in. And then it's all about building up that and then driving that awareness so like maybe hopefully it maybe they even reach out because they see that you became an influencer in that space, because you were doing a bunch of. a bunch of things along that journey to build that influence, maybe. I don't know bank people go to a specific meetup and there you know you start to go and short hair stuff there and. This VP of this executive bank is at that meetup and they saw your presentation, they want to give you a job now so it's just about putting yourself out there and engineering yourself and different positions. cool. Do you guys have any other questions. yeah. i'm Danny and I was wondering like you keep saying. How do I, like. Well, what makes you have to you have to ask yourself what makes you passionate you know what what what excites you what kind of things. are of interest to you so like let's say I love to play virtual reality, I like to do virtual out of games, or something like that. You know, and I want to be a virtual I like I want to work at oculus you know how can I engineer my projects and different things. and add a unique perspective that maybe they're not thinking about and then, how do I get in front of that community so when you want to like. So if I was doing vr ar I might do some different hackathons and then I might share what I did, and then tag oculus and stuff and then go to their community and share it try to find key influencers maybe even my local area. Even even been to the point where i'm going to be like I find somebody at oculus that lives in Minnesota and I connect with them on linkedin and say hey i'd love to go and grab a cup of coffee, you know, so you can you can you can do all these. Active things not and and try to build that up versus being like Oh, I always wanted to work at oculus go through school and then you. And then you got like oh I got my resume here you go and they'd be like I don't care about you, I don't know who you are you're just another resume like, how do you how do you not be that so like I guarantee you if, like. If you wanted to work at tiger, if you want to work at whatever company if you're doing all those different things they're going to be taking notice. It wasn't me who offered a job, to share it was our CEO and our CEO is like look at this person creating all this stuff because she was sharing all this. cool things on linkedin social media was in the forums, creating all these different things doing hackathons Vance that the the CEO said hey, we need to hire this person I said. All right, let's do it, you know and so she got a job right so that's that's what you need to do is is think through that and they don't teach you at that school, at least not the school, I went to. You did the vr game. But I don't really have like a vr. want to do something. What I said just if you don't know what you want to do yeah. um so one thing I would do is maybe start to explore like a kid so let's go back to oculus I have no idea anything about their Community so i'm just making all this stuff up. I will start to get like a deep dive into their Community what's resonating what are some like new product. Maybe even not start to think of like what are their new product releases and might, might I might start targeting like. Building a how to video with this new feature that they just released because that's always going to be hot like they're trying to get out the new features. And then i'd start to get my presence known and then I would start to just explore different things and come up with unique things in that space so maybe like Okay, how do you do, even if you wanted to combine air and graph, how do you do like. So we're talking to unity, right now, and how do we do, how do you do analytics on all the actions and behaviors and. People and users and stuff like that all that data is stored into a big graph and then you can run all the analytics that you went on to it so maybe you do something unique like that I do include vr. Video games with with analytics are you know you have to you have to just try to like feel it out go to you have to first go out there and try to explore. And then see where what what interests you or what what yeah but but a good way, though, is is if there's new features that come out and you start being the first one to shirt like share how to do stuff with those features that company is going to take notice, you know. that's that's one thing you could do. huh. yeah yeah I mean you have to really put your put yourself out there, since not asking simple in the way i've always given yeah. always be like give give give give and people are going to start taking notice of it but you're given like strategic like you have a reason why you're doing it. Thank you yeah. Any last minute questions. would be are correct. me. No, I don't work at a vr company I work at a graph database company. name is here. Oh, I was just giving I was just gonna example, so we were talking about how to engineer yourself and I just took a random a random company and was walking through how I would engineer myself and if I was going after that perspective john or role or company I got confused for a second. Sorry. I just heard that example. You could do that for any example, though. The big bank healthcare company, you know just engineer yourself doing strategic things to put your put yourself out there and getting visibility. Oh, I have like I kind of have an interesting question, what do you think, or what do you think are the next like big upcoming technologies that you feel I don't feel like are still pretty new but there they have like a huge potential to just. expanded become like pop things in CS. See yes um well. yeah they I mean quantum is definitely like the fringe of possible and impossible I think they know if they can never figure out quantum to work at scale. That would be a pretty interesting, one that would have ripple effects across many industries, you know what if you had quantum processors for cryptocurrency or quantum whatever processors for math equations and everybody can have those at home. Oh, one of the I guess it's not really a technology but it's an interesting it's an interesting thought exercises. there's a I don't know the exact number, but like billions at least a billion, I think, or more of people don't have Internet right now right there's just not the infrastructure, the network. spacex is coming out my parents have spacex at their house, so they just meld know are shooting up to sound like a 200 megs. Now if everyone has Internet, what are the, what are the, what are the conversations of that how am I market shifts happen that might be. That might be an interesting exercise but yeah graph that everyone's looking for different ways to do analytics in the grass face graph neural nets are getting pretty popular dnn. there's all there's every day there's a new gbt three new you know new language models and stuff like that, so one shot learning language models, I think there's always going to be a need for analytics. there's not enough data graph data scientist that's a short ever there's a lot of Python developers, but you know people that know know how to do these. Different data structures um yeah I would say. I would say. Another one would be. Digital twin is sort of a weird one in the sense that they're trying to. Do predictions about different things based off of other things, and so, if you look up digital trend twin you might find a lot of different things, but digital twin in the sense of users user applications, so that could be into recommendation engines. Digital twins in the sense of like medical means, how can you how can you find somebody that's super similar to yourself and then. You can make that better drug recommendations or you can run different analytics. But yeah blockchain technology is still have a long ways to go they're pretty pretty new. Then. there's a there's there's a lot of different ones, I would just I would, if I was you i'd follow gartner. The emerging trends and that changes every so that's when we were working at this emerging tech working on quantum Ai de de de de de we're following the gartner emerging trends so look up that it's called the hype cycle and i'll show you all the new things on the cusp of possibilities. Oh Okay, I never heard of that. yeah right chicken up. like this. yeah gartner and look at here i'll just share it. So this is this where I would go to like. So it looks like. This thing. So these are the emerging technologies. Oh, and F tease Ai driven augmentation quantum machine learning. So we can go back and see what the previous ones where it's a little hard to see carbon based trends transitions bring your own identity as citizen point digital twin here's digital twin they're talking about that. yeah so you can you can start to see data fabrics. The gardener has a lot of great information 2009 they're talking about five g still. But this is a great place to to look at the cusp of nascar 3D printing. flying a time as cars say that's more than 10 years from now. Low earth orbit satellites systems there, we do not the spacex so it was that one five years, I think that that that emerged a little bit. earlier. So yeah that's what I would look at and follow those reports partners really good at submitting those on what's what's new. Are you still working on that jarvis thing. I haven't I haven't for a while, actually, it was talking to a university that they wanted to incorporate graph and virtual reality like to walk through like the Meta. an. And I was suggested doing the jarvis project with them, but I haven't had enough resources to actually build my own jarvis type project, because the ultimate goal would be like, just as you were talking to jarvis. You could use alexa and then maybe some like virtual reality on mentation who like walk through information and stuff. Just never had the chance to to to focus on it so but, hopefully, hopefully, I can propose this idea to this university I think it's an Ohio. That they'll have a bunch of students that could work on building something along that lines because and will just help guide them mentor them along MySpace because that's what she wants to do something vr with graph so that was pretty cool. Any other any other questions. guys any questions audience. No, I think we're good. yeah thanks for thanks for coming here and spending the time just talk about those then provide your your thoughts and insights on things. yeah yeah and feel free to Ping me on discord if you want like hey. i'm thinking about doing this, could you have do you have any advice, how to approach that. You know, or if you have a dream job and you want us to somebody else to drift off of how you can successfully get yourself in there, let me know more than willing to to help coach or mentor. Oh, I actually had a question, so I was thinking about doing like a graph database it's like trying to model like something about students like sleep better or something. But I wasn't really sure how to go about that, but I was just thinking like for like I don't know how I would like collect data or anything like that, so I wanted to ask you, like how, how do you like get data for like these kind of projects. yeah sometimes on kaggle we've done fitbit data with tiger graph at my previous company adopt them and basically we just asked everyone to share their fitbit data, just like you would share your linkedin data. And so we did a data dump of their their data. That my coworker is actually the primary. The my coworkers the primary driver of that that initiative and that product, so if that's something that really interests you i'll tell them to to to chat with you, and he can tell you all about how to structure it up for fitbit data. yeah. I don't think there's many blogs on that either So if you create some can share it with everybody. right for like fitbit data yeah I haven't I haven't seen I he created an iot you create an iot graph on if you go to YouTube and then go to tie graph and then look up iot I think there's some iot based stuff he created. And, but it was it was more arm, you know, like whether or is more like temperature and humidity sensing but I mean the same concept, you know streaming data. yeah. yeah I think all. Right, thank you. All right, it's good to see you guys. \""

       "Five four. cool. All right, well. Thank you all for being here and thanks for having me as a guest at this this this meetup here and yeah I can give you a background about myself, you know how how. My career has landed me to lead a developer relations team at Silicon Valley startup and I work in Minnesota, but I can tell you my journey of how I I now work for one of the hottest startups startups in Silicon Valley. And I can give you my deep background and also how features can be kicked off in the beginning, you know so let's see where I where do I want to get started um. yeah i'll start with my i'll start with my work history so. I I joined the army National Guard before I went to college my my i've always been interested in computers and understand how computers work so when I joined. The military I wanted to graduate debt free was my goal from college, I did I don't want to have any debt when I graduated so that was my primary reason for for joining the military and. get some free education, so I joined the military what I was doing was a computer networking engineer I go out in the middle of nowhere shoot up to a satellite grabbing up link deploy network and programs routers and switches so very network focused. and building up so you'd have like nothing you'd be out in the middle of a cornfield and there's nothing there you bring all your trucks and your tents and whatnot and your computers and. Your networking stacks and you, we have to set up the base of operations and then by the end of US setting this up now you have computers and phones and whatnot. So I got a lot of clearances and I had my secrets cured clans by the Department of Defense and all these networking certifications So when I went through college I tested out of some classes, because they're so boring. And I was never a big fan of school but i'm a very passionate person about learning I love education, I love learning I love being creative. But school was not my favorite thing to be honest and so anyways yeah so I went to I went to mankato State University just because my My family has a lot of history down there, and my grandpa was professor and my parents went there so that's where i'd family nearby. So I went I went there that degree and CS basically with focus on networking security, and you know I had a background in that, and then I, my first job as an intern was working at united health group. I don't know if you've heard of united health group or optum. They have a really cool program it's called the technology development program so we're one of the pioneers to this this new program that they're trying to create now if you go to college anywhere in Minnesota you'll probably have these. Optimum recruiters telling you all about the Program. Which is a rotational program so I got in there as an intern I was a super intern I was. Harry had, I had a higher clearance level than everybody in the $6 billion data centers I can go into any server rooms swap different things out figure different things. And yeah I started doing networking got really bored really fast of doing that work and engineering a big giant company had the opportunity to. join this sort of creative startup incubator inside this giant company called optimum and it was very. Very business model focused I don't know if you know the lean methodology it's a great book if you if you haven't read that before. Running lean talks about how you can create a startup and what steps you need to take so we we follow this methodology. I think a great example of that would be like uber you know cars existed phones existed, it was just reimagining airbnb another great one. it's reimagining the way that the business, you know, using what's out there reimagining the way a business operates. And so we're doing that, from a healthcare perspective, so I was a founder in residence at this this startup incubator. And then, in August 2016 we started seeing emerging technologies really disrupt different industries. And this is everything from Ai technologies natural language trusts machine learning deep learning computer vision, the list of Ai stuff goes on and on how blockchain technologies Internet of Things quantum computing and graph databases. And so, for coming from the networking world I lean heavy into into the into the graph space interconnected data and the more I was in this is where this is where we started to. formulate the futurist academy is I was doing a lot of things where i'd take my education about blockchain or Ai natural language processing. graph databases and I start to go to Community events in different schools, I went to EDEN prairie and that's where I met. There was an ios developer team and that's where I met real hon anyways I was asked to come to the EDEN prairie school and give a talk about blockchain, and so we launched a cryptocurrency live in class on the test net. So we talked about how blockchains work and how cryptocurrency works, but I was doing a lot of these different events, where I was engaging with different. Different students in different meetups and different things, and people kept asking how can we be part of this, how can we be part of something where we're connected Community that is. Constantly learning, and so the reason I wanted to also create futures camp is not only to create that house, but also for the ability. to discover new passions and learn from one another, also I hated school, and so I you know I thought. there's so many opportunities that you can engineer yourself if you just put your mind to it and being. passionate and learning about new things, and you can engineer yourself your own opportunity that you might want to do so if you wanted to work at tesla, how do you get there, if you want to work at the neuro link project, how can you get there. How can you engineer yourself into that kind of position. So anyways that's how a feature set Kevin was really created was not by my thought of creating a features coming it was more based off demand of other people wanting to be part of a community that intermingled. So then yeah I got I got a call from tiger graph and they're like we want you to be a technology evangelist i'm from Minnesota I have no idea all the terminology from. Silicon Valley, so I was like what's the technology evangelist they're like we would just want you to do what you're doing but do it for us do meetups do events do blogs do videos do engagements help. Help other developers understand the technology, and so, two years ago I jumped off of usg after working there for six and a half years. and made the transition to to tiger graph and so now i've been here for for two years and training, training people up nurturing the commute I run the Community for for tiger graph we do a lot of different events and. and challenges and do a lot of Community engagement a lot Open Source projects my favorite thing to do is is. Share other people's projects in the Community, so if I see something cool on github or somebody reaches out, I always like to to advocate and share their blogs and get it repost it on social media. But yeah that's that's a crash course in my my life and my background and networking engineer to founder and residents to building out emerging tech lab. To doing a lot of Community engagement to ultimately being a developer, leaving the developer relations team here at tiger graph so. Any any questions on the journey. yeah go ahead. I was what. How is working for tech graph it's it's awesome. yeah no it's it's um if you're not familiar, I mean so graph databases power pretty much everything, today you just might not know know about it. And Google Google declared a blog that says things not strings if you ever want to look it up. And it was their declaration of them using graph to interconnect all the data together so that uncanny ability. When you're when you're browsing different things and ads pop up. that's because they're doing all of these different things that are all interconnected and that could includes not only your behaviors but other people's like similar people like you and their behaviors. If you look at the algorithms for netflix or HBO is a customer of ours, how you're able to recommend content that that's powered by graph under the hood of linkedin is powered by graph Facebook under the hood of pinterest even huge companies doing analytical. Like way fer, for example, there's so many different applications of graph and it's weird because, not a lot of people understand that, but I think what I love about tiger graph. Is that there's not many tools out there that are for scale that are make this technology available for everybody, so uber and all these companies have their own proprietary graph solutions. That they home grown and built what tiger raft neo for Jay Cambridge semantics, some of them are labeled property graphs and some of them are already F graphs like star dog. But what these technology companies do is enable everybody as a developer and customers and consumers, whatever you want to call them. To have that power of these big giant tech companies, so my favorite part, though, is tiger graph is. We feel we're far ahead of other other companies and so it's cool just to be at a company that just as sort of a leader in that space we haven't been around the longest but we definitely have the fastest technology platform so. yeah other than that the people are great the jobs great I love helping people I it's it's a work hard play it play hard. work hard work hard play hard anyways we do a lot of different things. And leadership's great as far as giving us full. I wouldn't say control but but gives us the breathing space to allow us to innovate and do the things that we want to do that really are targeted towards. Whatever we're trying to drive in my in my perspective, i'm trying to grow adoption i'm trying to get more people to understand how to use the technology. and grow the Community, so I do a lot of different events, so I love, a lot of things yeah. I guess, I guess, one question i've asked is just from your perspective, what do you feel are the main things to take away from college, other than just learning. Just just like learning the general topics that you have in your classes like what are the main things you can take advantage in that experience. um so one thing I would have done differently in college if I, and one thing that they never teach you in college is. they'll give you the book, but what you want to do there's two things you want to build influence and you want to build connections Those are the two things i'll get you anywhere in life. So building influence is done by sharing right So if you learn something in school, besides just the school project, how can you apply what you learned and build something cool and then share it share it on github share it through. share it through blogs or videos but, more importantly, how can you take, how can you amplify what you share to become so let's say you learn like a really. let's say you learn how to do like. I know you're doing data science and maybe you're putting a ui on top of a data science problem or something like that or how okay let's do stage maker so let's say you're doing some machine learning right. you're learning to do some data science right and you build this really cool thing on stage maker, so if it was me, I would, I would not only do it for class, but I would be like. Okay, I built this really cool. thing i'm going to have really great documentation i'm going to do a blog made a video then i'm going to go to the stage maker Community forum, then i'm going to start posting about it, then i'm going to try to reach out to whoever's leading that community. make them aware of it, and then try to drive more visibility into that so you're trying to build up like. you're taking something that Okay, you could have just learned it and then took the test and then forgot about it but you're you're you're you could take it so much farther. So that kind of thing will be built around a lot of relationships so there's a lot of that stuff they don't teach you in school, and I think if you do those kind of things you can. You can far outpaced your peers, especially once you get to the point where you want to land your dream job you can engineer yourself into your dream job. Right, so you can literally craft these things when I hire people. I look at their github I look at what they're talking about what they do, like everyone could say stuff on resumes but then, if I see like a YouTube video and like blogs, and their github projects, and I can see all this things and they're not just like. Oh, look at my resume cool I took this basic class whatever like I really don't care. Even if you have a 4.0 i'll hire somebody that never even went to college that literally is just like out there and showing the proof in the pudding not not not somebody that just says they're good at something so anyways. that's what I would do different and that's what I would encourage throughout college is building connections and building up credibility and engineering yourself, while you're doing that. So, like, I understand, like. large scale application. databases. yeah you could you could I could just share a couple things that i'm building right now that are small scale, maybe gives you some ideas. Sure yeah so one, let me see if I can share my. yep just give you a call to work. So even even you can create something like this. So of course I use tg cloud because it's free it's easy to use, so feel free to use tg cloud it's Nice because you can do a lot of different things and engage, you can you can interface with it and you don't have to say anything out. But this is wait, the system, the one. Let me to. log into this one, this is my linkedin graph so this one, this one you guys could do even it's pretty straightforward basically what I wanted to do is, I wanted to see all the interconnections between some of my colleagues at work. So I went to design schema so under the hood of linkedin as they're actually doing this, if you go to like your people, and you go to my network and you go to connections. trying to find, where it says like first degree second degree and stuff. But you guys know what i'm you know i'm talking about right first degrees here this first degree second degree third degree, so this means john's connected to. Dan and the first degree and then Dan might have a friend, but i'm not connected to them so there's a second degree and then there's third degree, so one of the neat things you can do with this and pretty much with all. All your social media is you can go to settings and privacy and then you can go to data privacy and get a copy of your data and then you can grab your connections. So you can fetch it. And then, what we're doing was so we had a list of like I think there's 20 other people, and we had them drop their connections, and so the data file, you can get the company, the position and person and see if you can explore ground. So you know here here's a here's a bunch of different companies yeah you can just click on where's this person work. This person works at whatever company that's called. This is the position. Alright, so and nobody else woman design magazine, so you just start crawling us there's probably more than one account manager has a role so let's see. yeah so you can you can start to see different different you know different views here if i'm just manually creating. crawling us, but the things I wanted to do was how can I find who's connected to who maybe by a company. So I just wrote wrote some basic queries like get connections of a person, so this one, if I do. See somebody I know. Now, I can see who's connected to my work with Dan mccurry who's an optimum employee. And then, how do I take this further one of the cool things that tiger APP has is that you can get everything as a as a rest endpoint so, then what we did was and I don't have the shame, I have it open just a second, let me pull something up. to pull this up so, then I wanted to put a gui on it, because there's I don't want people to interface with the database, I just wanted them to have something. super simple so i'm just going to click on this. yeah graphical user interface, so we built. This is this is called a read ash is the the tooling This allows you to build like a bar charts line charts pie charts and all those kind of things. And, and this in a table, of course, so that queries feed into this table so it's taking json and converting it to a data frame, but then I can search, you know I can be like Okay, who all works at silence. You know that that i'm connected to so who's connected to who I know that works at this company so that's like one small use case the other we're doing some other stuff if you guys are familiar discord. yeah yeah we're building one one of our use cases and I don't know if I have it here. Is we're basically pulling all of our discord information out then running nlp through the discord so, then we can see what people are talking about and then building a knowledge graph so we can basically. And then you can put a chat Bot, on top of that, or do whatever you want or put you can put a dashboard on to it and see what you know how many times people talk about a certain let's say Python how many times that people say Python and community. So you can put like analytical dashboard with your with your with your data from discord that's another sort of side project and we're doing that, beyond discord we're going into discord reddit. We were doing news post so we're basically what our thought was for this little side project was can we build like. What we know about ourselves, but then also what we know about other people or other communities so like competitors of analysis tool, so we can analyze other other communities, so you can go to. This Community where are they talking about maybe some news post come up What were they talking about are putting this all this interconnected graph solution. So that's another small one here we're making this graph specifically is pretty simplistic it's just got users and assets and tags basically we're building a clone of pinterest is what what this this this one that i'm currently on. So yeah you could I mean you could you could there's so many different things, and so many different ways that you could use graph. These are just some of the things that i'm actively working on right now. Hopefully that answered the question but yeah you could sky's the limit for different ideas. yeah another actually another resource that you guys might like. This was developed by one of. Our interns as a student as a freshman. it's really cool because it walks you through every single step and. Have you guys ever heard of plot Lee or dash i'm assuming everyone knows Python right. yeah yeah. Okay cool So if you know Python you'll be superstars. This one. And here. So you can with politely politely and dash so partly as a visualization component library bar charts line charts all those kind of chart charity things. dash allows you to put things into. If you've heard of streamline dashes like a dashboard in tool, but a little bit more advanced, you can do a lot more different things like multi pages and and whatnot so Python based So if you know pipeline, you can build these pretty fast. This one this one's like healthcare data this one's coven 19 data, this one is movie I be ID bm, I think, is what it is, or this one. One of our developer advocates put a bunch of arduino sensors in his room, it was sensing different data streaming wait, maybe not this one, one of these that he was doing was streaming data from sensors. But all of these have full notebooks you can literally run through this and recreate it, but then what this Quick Start guide also allows you to do. is literally go see sorry there's to start the Quick Start is like just going to the basics, the adventure is more like the storytelling. Put a whole story together about how how you can navigate every single step and use this this library so everything from like nav bars to sidebars and whatnot so i'll drop this into the. chat but the cool thing about visualization ones is these usually resonate pretty well on like your linkedin and whatnot every time I posted I get like. 200 300 likes a lot of people like visualization stuff so what i'll do sometimes is i'll create like an APP and then i'll take a video of it and they'll convert it to a gift and then put it into a linkedin to share. Well, what is the name of that Google blog posts, you said that like is like things strings. Oh things not strings. Okay okay. yeah. I can you want me to share have an old back if maybe for those people that aren't familiar with. Some of the things. So I do a lot of presentations and so I have a lot of these decks. So I think there's an interesting one. yeah I can start here so here's a bunch of different like graph use cases and he's have different people are using us so like Jaguar Land Rover is really tracing their whole supply chain. You know let's say a ship gets stuck in a canal, what does that impact on all the different parts and things across all of our products and services. You have like wish COM that's looking at transaction history. You have networking operationally you have everything from like deep link analytics so doing multi hops tracing that's another thing like doing doing deep transactional traces. A lot of people aren't using a tie graph for the cool one that, I mean knowledge graphs are pretty that's like Google, you know search knowledge graphs that's that's pretty traditional the coolest one that's not listed on here, let me get seeping into it. So, most of the customers have like this, but these are powered by. The powered by a. graph analytics oh yeah here, this might be helpful for some people. So, like. This is this is basically what that sample project was doing so, I have a bunch of connections, if you had your all your connections interconnected, this is what it look like, if you visualize sell your stuff so that's really what's under the hood. And this was just me breaking it Okay, if I was going to break build linkedin graph How would I deconstruct it, these are all the different components, so if you start thinking like graph this is how I look. At these different things, and then here's the part that we just talked about having first degree second degree third degree connections and then you run different algorithms that create fields, so a lot of different social social. Social platforms do stuff like this. This is going into another one, so how to do recommendation engines it's using cosine similarity algorithms. Everything you do is tracked everything you do, as far as a click hover over how long you're on a page. All these different things are metrics that you're that you can store into your Meta graph and you can do you can use to to create a product recommendations, of course, we talked about. Google and things not strings blog 2015 pretty sure I think that's when it came out that there may be most famous algorithms called page rank. So pagerank is just calculating the influence score. From vertex vertex I think now they change their their algorithm of how they derive the content. But that's what they used to use, and that was based off Larry page, this is my favorite one and coolest one is they're doing real real real time. transaction energy loads so they're like analyzing the integrated system at in real time and to redistribute or like. Reporting on all these different you know substations to this, and this, and so they can recalibrate you know what's what's happening in real time across the energy grid system. which I think is critical, this is the supply chain back thinking about Land Rover Jaguar Land Rover so you have. You know suppliers parts features and cars, so you might have features that are tied to multiple different parts, you know what happens if this part doesn't get somewhere because of that, what are the, what are the cut conversations effects from that. These are, this is more like anti resolution fraud so you're looking at you know the users with maybe the same IP same same address maybe they try to log into a different account but they're at the same IP you can track all those different things and do traces. This one's really cool for into machine learning Ai, how can you do. graph based future generation, so you know traditional features, you have the tabular structure, you can look at the structure of the data and the interconnectedness of the data to to drive new feature or new features, they can use in your machine learning algorithm. Know what's the difference between like a good phone and a bad phone in this. yeah yeah so you know this, this is actually implementation at China mobile Have you ever had do you have an iPhone that says spam, sometimes it pops up. yeah it's like scam likely or something like that. yeah so what that that's doing right here that's that's basically what it is it's popping that button up and doing it based off these features so. The bad phone gets a lot of rejections like people don't answer just rejected right when it's so that's one thing, the number of callbacks nobody's calling back that phone so bad phone if there's a short call duration, so you can pick up in these like. Maybe it's some automated message usually then then people hang up right away so there's all of these characteristics about. Bad phone even average distance so like this phone isn't kindness one that's kindness one now let's go to the other side. You have a good phone maybe this is uconn your mom your mom's Klein your dad your dad's calling your. aunt or whatever you know there's these interconnection of groups of phone calls going on there's also long durations of calls there's also numerous calls, you probably call your mom or dad grandpa a lot of different times and usually they have connections and there's. A stable group of like phone numbers yours calling So these are these are features that I think there was like 250 features that they generated I don't know how many of them, they use but. yeah, this is a deep link. And you know how you you weren't able to download the data for that linkedin you're able to just like go in and download, are there any other data sources were like just for different applications where you could just go and get that. um yeah there's. You can comfort pretty much anything that's in tabular format to to to graph format, so one way, I would, if you're if you're interested or thinking about doing that is you. can go to the learning sessions that are going on right now the fourth one is just about to come out. So if you go tiger graph i'd watch these two videos because my my coworker is putting together for a brand new like if you're brand new to tiger graph how to start thinking about graph. It would be part one of this graph one on one so it's just just came out recently in Part Two part three, is coming out tomorrow. But it's taking somebody from the mindset of I have never heard of graph and now I have some tabular data that I want to explore so whatever that tabular data is. How do I start to think and graph and interconnect that in graph and how do I derive what I want to drive out of it so that's that's what I would recommend is watching this part one and part two. Okay. But yeah so like in the past we've had some interns that wanted to engineer themselves into working at. One of our customers places, so you did a lot of projects that were pertaining to finance of fraud, and so, you know as as an intern he created all these different Open Source projects blogs and videos and then he. Basically, went to the hiring manager at this this bank and said. They were there recruiting actively at the time and said yeah i'd love to work with you and and then they said yeah we really want you, and then he was negotiating his salary as an intern to basically double his salary. Because he had all the proof it wasn't like he said Oh, I worked on paragraph on his resume it was literally like. Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so you know he engineered himself into that that kind of position but that's what you could do as well, so like if you wanted to. work at tesla or work at wherever How would you engineer yourself into to be in that position, and you might need somebody that can help guide you or be a mentor as well. yeah I think that's an interesting concept, just like with the engineering yourself that you can it's not like you can just start off with nothing and still just do different things to build yourself up in that way. yeah yeah you just you just ask yourself, you try to figure out like where where you can. provide the most like, how can you how can you demonstrate that you can provide value in that perspective space that you want to be in. And then it's all about building up that and then driving that awareness so like maybe hopefully it maybe they even reach out because they see that you became an influencer in that space, because you were doing a bunch of. a bunch of things along that journey to build that influence, maybe. I don't know bank people go to a specific meetup and there you know you start to go and short hair stuff there and. This VP of this executive bank is at that meetup and they saw your presentation, they want to give you a job now so it's just about putting yourself out there and engineering yourself and different positions. cool. Do you guys have any other questions. yeah. i'm Danny and I was wondering like you keep saying. How do I, like. Well, what makes you have to you have to ask yourself what makes you passionate you know what what what excites you what kind of things. are of interest to you so like let's say I love to play virtual reality, I like to do virtual out of games, or something like that. You know, and I want to be a virtual I like I want to work at oculus you know how can I engineer my projects and different things. and add a unique perspective that maybe they're not thinking about and then, how do I get in front of that community so when you want to like. So if I was doing vr ar I might do some different hackathons and then I might share what I did, and then tag oculus and stuff and then go to their community and share it try to find key influencers maybe even my local area. Even even been to the point where i'm going to be like I find somebody at oculus that lives in Minnesota and I connect with them on linkedin and say hey i'd love to go and grab a cup of coffee, you know, so you can you can you can do all these. Active things not and and try to build that up versus being like Oh, I always wanted to work at oculus go through school and then you. And then you got like oh I got my resume here you go and they'd be like I don't care about you, I don't know who you are you're just another resume like, how do you how do you not be that so like I guarantee you if, like. If you wanted to work at tiger, if you want to work at whatever company if you're doing all those different things they're going to be taking notice. It wasn't me who offered a job, to share it was our CEO and our CEO is like look at this person creating all this stuff because she was sharing all this. cool things on linkedin social media was in the forums, creating all these different things doing hackathons Vance that the the CEO said hey, we need to hire this person I said. All right, let's do it, you know and so she got a job right so that's that's what you need to do is is think through that and they don't teach you at that school, at least not the school, I went to. You did the vr game. But I don't really have like a vr. want to do something. What I said just if you don't know what you want to do yeah. um so one thing I would do is maybe start to explore like a kid so let's go back to oculus I have no idea anything about their Community so i'm just making all this stuff up. I will start to get like a deep dive into their Community what's resonating what are some like new product. Maybe even not start to think of like what are their new product releases and might, might I might start targeting like. Building a how to video with this new feature that they just released because that's always going to be hot like they're trying to get out the new features. And then i'd start to get my presence known and then I would start to just explore different things and come up with unique things in that space so maybe like Okay, how do you do, even if you wanted to combine air and graph, how do you do like. So we're talking to unity, right now, and how do we do, how do you do analytics on all the actions and behaviors and. People and users and stuff like that all that data is stored into a big graph and then you can run all the analytics that you went on to it so maybe you do something unique like that I do include vr. Video games with with analytics are you know you have to you have to just try to like feel it out go to you have to first go out there and try to explore. And then see where what what interests you or what what yeah but but a good way, though, is is if there's new features that come out and you start being the first one to shirt like share how to do stuff with those features that company is going to take notice, you know. that's that's one thing you could do. huh. yeah yeah I mean you have to really put your put yourself out there, since not asking simple in the way i've always given yeah. always be like give give give give and people are going to start taking notice of it but you're given like strategic like you have a reason why you're doing it. Thank you yeah. Any last minute questions. would be are correct. me. No, I don't work at a vr company I work at a graph database company. name is here. Oh, I was just giving I was just gonna example, so we were talking about how to engineer yourself and I just took a random a random company and was walking through how I would engineer myself and if I was going after that perspective john or role or company I got confused for a second. Sorry. I just heard that example. You could do that for any example, though. The big bank healthcare company, you know just engineer yourself doing strategic things to put your put yourself out there and getting visibility. Oh, I have like I kind of have an interesting question, what do you think, or what do you think are the next like big upcoming technologies that you feel I don't feel like are still pretty new but there they have like a huge potential to just. expanded become like pop things in CS. See yes um well. yeah they I mean quantum is definitely like the fringe of possible and impossible I think they know if they can never figure out quantum to work at scale. That would be a pretty interesting, one that would have ripple effects across many industries, you know what if you had quantum processors for cryptocurrency or quantum whatever processors for math equations and everybody can have those at home. Oh, one of the I guess it's not really a technology but it's an interesting it's an interesting thought exercises. there's a I don't know the exact number, but like billions at least a billion, I think, or more of people don't have Internet right now right there's just not the infrastructure, the network. spacex is coming out my parents have spacex at their house, so they just meld know are shooting up to sound like a 200 megs. Now if everyone has Internet, what are the, what are the, what are the conversations of that how am I market shifts happen that might be. That might be an interesting exercise but yeah graph that everyone's looking for different ways to do analytics in the grass face graph neural nets are getting pretty popular dnn. there's all there's every day there's a new gbt three new you know new language models and stuff like that, so one shot learning language models, I think there's always going to be a need for analytics. there's not enough data graph data scientist that's a short ever there's a lot of Python developers, but you know people that know know how to do these. Different data structures um yeah I would say. I would say. Another one would be. Digital twin is sort of a weird one in the sense that they're trying to. Do predictions about different things based off of other things, and so, if you look up digital trend twin you might find a lot of different things, but digital twin in the sense of users user applications, so that could be into recommendation engines. Digital twins in the sense of like medical means, how can you how can you find somebody that's super similar to yourself and then. You can make that better drug recommendations or you can run different analytics. But yeah blockchain technology is still have a long ways to go they're pretty pretty new. Then. there's a there's there's a lot of different ones, I would just I would, if I was you i'd follow gartner. The emerging trends and that changes every so that's when we were working at this emerging tech working on quantum Ai de de de de de we're following the gartner emerging trends so look up that it's called the hype cycle and i'll show you all the new things on the cusp of possibilities. Oh Okay, I never heard of that. yeah right chicken up. like this. yeah gartner and look at here i'll just share it. So this is this where I would go to like. So it looks like. This thing. So these are the emerging technologies. Oh, and F tease Ai driven augmentation quantum machine learning. So we can go back and see what the previous ones where it's a little hard to see carbon based trends transitions bring your own identity as citizen point digital twin here's digital twin they're talking about that. yeah so you can you can start to see data fabrics. The gardener has a lot of great information 2009 they're talking about five g still. But this is a great place to to look at the cusp of nascar 3D printing. flying a time as cars say that's more than 10 years from now. Low earth orbit satellites systems there, we do not the spacex so it was that one five years, I think that that that emerged a little bit. earlier. So yeah that's what I would look at and follow those reports partners really good at submitting those on what's what's new. Are you still working on that jarvis thing. I haven't I haven't for a while, actually, it was talking to a university that they wanted to incorporate graph and virtual reality like to walk through like the Meta. an. And I was suggested doing the jarvis project with them, but I haven't had enough resources to actually build my own jarvis type project, because the ultimate goal would be like, just as you were talking to jarvis. You could use alexa and then maybe some like virtual reality on mentation who like walk through information and stuff. Just never had the chance to to to focus on it so but, hopefully, hopefully, I can propose this idea to this university I think it's an Ohio. That they'll have a bunch of students that could work on building something along that lines because and will just help guide them mentor them along MySpace because that's what she wants to do something vr with graph so that was pretty cool. Any other any other questions. guys any questions audience. No, I think we're good. yeah thanks for thanks for coming here and spending the time just talk about those then provide your your thoughts and insights on things. yeah yeah and feel free to Ping me on discord if you want like hey. i'm thinking about doing this, could you have do you have any advice, how to approach that. You know, or if you have a dream job and you want us to somebody else to drift off of how you can successfully get yourself in there, let me know more than willing to to help coach or mentor. Oh, I actually had a question, so I was thinking about doing like a graph database it's like trying to model like something about students like sleep better or something. But I wasn't really sure how to go about that, but I was just thinking like for like I don't know how I would like collect data or anything like that, so I wanted to ask you, like how, how do you like get data for like these kind of projects. yeah sometimes on kaggle we've done fitbit data with tiger graph at my previous company adopt them and basically we just asked everyone to share their fitbit data, just like you would share your linkedin data. And so we did a data dump of their their data. That my coworker is actually the primary. The my coworkers the primary driver of that that initiative and that product, so if that's something that really interests you i'll tell them to to to chat with you, and he can tell you all about how to structure it up for fitbit data. yeah. I don't think there's many blogs on that either So if you create some can share it with everybody. right for like fitbit data yeah I haven't I haven't seen I he created an iot you create an iot graph on if you go to YouTube and then go to tie graph and then look up iot I think there's some iot based stuff he created. And, but it was it was more arm, you know, like whether or is more like temperature and humidity sensing but I mean the same concept, you know streaming data. yeah. yeah I think all. Right, thank you. All right, it's good to see you guys. "

       "\"Five four. cool. All right, well. Thank you all for being here and thanks for having me as a guest at this this this meetup here and yeah I can give you a background about myself, you know how how. My career has landed me to lead a developer relations team at Silicon Valley startup and I work in Minnesota, but I can tell you my journey of how I I now work for one of the hottest startups startups in Silicon Valley. And I can give you my deep background and also how features can be kicked off in the beginning, you know so let's see where I where do I want to get started um. yeah i'll start with my i'll start with my work history so. I I joined the army National Guard before I went to college my my i've always been interested in computers and understand how computers work so when I joined. The military I wanted to graduate debt free was my goal from college, I did I don't want to have any debt when I graduated so that was my primary reason for for joining the military and. get some free education, so I joined the military what I was doing was a computer networking engineer I go out in the middle of nowhere shoot up to a satellite grabbing up link deploy network and programs routers and switches so very network focused. and building up so you'd have like nothing you'd be out in the middle of a cornfield and there's nothing there you bring all your trucks and your tents and whatnot and your computers and. Your networking stacks and you, we have to set up the base of operations and then by the end of US setting this up now you have computers and phones and whatnot. So I got a lot of clearances and I had my secrets cured clans by the Department of Defense and all these networking certifications So when I went through college I tested out of some classes, because they're so boring. And I was never a big fan of school but i'm a very passionate person about learning I love education, I love learning I love being creative. But school was not my favorite thing to be honest and so anyways yeah so I went to I went to mankato State University just because my My family has a lot of history down there, and my grandpa was professor and my parents went there so that's where i'd family nearby. So I went I went there that degree and CS basically with focus on networking security, and you know I had a background in that, and then I, my first job as an intern was working at united health group. I don't know if you've heard of united health group or optum. They have a really cool program it's called the technology development program so we're one of the pioneers to this this new program that they're trying to create now if you go to college anywhere in Minnesota you'll probably have these. Optimum recruiters telling you all about the Program. Which is a rotational program so I got in there as an intern I was a super intern I was. Harry had, I had a higher clearance level than everybody in the $6 billion data centers I can go into any server rooms swap different things out figure different things. And yeah I started doing networking got really bored really fast of doing that work and engineering a big giant company had the opportunity to. join this sort of creative startup incubator inside this giant company called optimum and it was very. Very business model focused I don't know if you know the lean methodology it's a great book if you if you haven't read that before. Running lean talks about how you can create a startup and what steps you need to take so we we follow this methodology. I think a great example of that would be like uber you know cars existed phones existed, it was just reimagining airbnb another great one. it's reimagining the way that the business, you know, using what's out there reimagining the way a business operates. And so we're doing that, from a healthcare perspective, so I was a founder in residence at this this startup incubator. And then, in August 2016 we started seeing emerging technologies really disrupt different industries. And this is everything from Ai technologies natural language trusts machine learning deep learning computer vision, the list of Ai stuff goes on and on how blockchain technologies Internet of Things quantum computing and graph databases. And so, for coming from the networking world I lean heavy into into the into the graph space interconnected data and the more I was in this is where this is where we started to. formulate the futurist academy is I was doing a lot of things where i'd take my education about blockchain or Ai natural language processing. graph databases and I start to go to Community events in different schools, I went to EDEN prairie and that's where I met. There was an ios developer team and that's where I met real hon anyways I was asked to come to the EDEN prairie school and give a talk about blockchain, and so we launched a cryptocurrency live in class on the test net. So we talked about how blockchains work and how cryptocurrency works, but I was doing a lot of these different events, where I was engaging with different. Different students in different meetups and different things, and people kept asking how can we be part of this, how can we be part of something where we're connected Community that is. Constantly learning, and so the reason I wanted to also create futures camp is not only to create that house, but also for the ability. to discover new passions and learn from one another, also I hated school, and so I you know I thought. there's so many opportunities that you can engineer yourself if you just put your mind to it and being. passionate and learning about new things, and you can engineer yourself your own opportunity that you might want to do so if you wanted to work at tesla, how do you get there, if you want to work at the neuro link project, how can you get there. How can you engineer yourself into that kind of position. So anyways that's how a feature set Kevin was really created was not by my thought of creating a features coming it was more based off demand of other people wanting to be part of a community that intermingled. So then yeah I got I got a call from tiger graph and they're like we want you to be a technology evangelist i'm from Minnesota I have no idea all the terminology from. Silicon Valley, so I was like what's the technology evangelist they're like we would just want you to do what you're doing but do it for us do meetups do events do blogs do videos do engagements help. Help other developers understand the technology, and so, two years ago I jumped off of usg after working there for six and a half years. and made the transition to to tiger graph and so now i've been here for for two years and training, training people up nurturing the commute I run the Community for for tiger graph we do a lot of different events and. and challenges and do a lot of Community engagement a lot Open Source projects my favorite thing to do is is. Share other people's projects in the Community, so if I see something cool on github or somebody reaches out, I always like to to advocate and share their blogs and get it repost it on social media. But yeah that's that's a crash course in my my life and my background and networking engineer to founder and residents to building out emerging tech lab. To doing a lot of Community engagement to ultimately being a developer, leaving the developer relations team here at tiger graph so. Any any questions on the journey. yeah go ahead. I was what. How is working for tech graph it's it's awesome. yeah no it's it's um if you're not familiar, I mean so graph databases power pretty much everything, today you just might not know know about it. And Google Google declared a blog that says things not strings if you ever want to look it up. And it was their declaration of them using graph to interconnect all the data together so that uncanny ability. When you're when you're browsing different things and ads pop up. that's because they're doing all of these different things that are all interconnected and that could includes not only your behaviors but other people's like similar people like you and their behaviors. If you look at the algorithms for netflix or HBO is a customer of ours, how you're able to recommend content that that's powered by graph under the hood of linkedin is powered by graph Facebook under the hood of pinterest even huge companies doing analytical. Like way fer, for example, there's so many different applications of graph and it's weird because, not a lot of people understand that, but I think what I love about tiger graph. Is that there's not many tools out there that are for scale that are make this technology available for everybody, so uber and all these companies have their own proprietary graph solutions. That they home grown and built what tiger raft neo for Jay Cambridge semantics, some of them are labeled property graphs and some of them are already F graphs like star dog. But what these technology companies do is enable everybody as a developer and customers and consumers, whatever you want to call them. To have that power of these big giant tech companies, so my favorite part, though, is tiger graph is. We feel we're far ahead of other other companies and so it's cool just to be at a company that just as sort of a leader in that space we haven't been around the longest but we definitely have the fastest technology platform so. yeah other than that the people are great the jobs great I love helping people I it's it's a work hard play it play hard. work hard work hard play hard anyways we do a lot of different things. And leadership's great as far as giving us full. I wouldn't say control but but gives us the breathing space to allow us to innovate and do the things that we want to do that really are targeted towards. Whatever we're trying to drive in my in my perspective, i'm trying to grow adoption i'm trying to get more people to understand how to use the technology. and grow the Community, so I do a lot of different events, so I love, a lot of things yeah. I guess, I guess, one question i've asked is just from your perspective, what do you feel are the main things to take away from college, other than just learning. Just just like learning the general topics that you have in your classes like what are the main things you can take advantage in that experience. um so one thing I would have done differently in college if I, and one thing that they never teach you in college is. they'll give you the book, but what you want to do there's two things you want to build influence and you want to build connections Those are the two things i'll get you anywhere in life. So building influence is done by sharing right So if you learn something in school, besides just the school project, how can you apply what you learned and build something cool and then share it share it on github share it through. share it through blogs or videos but, more importantly, how can you take, how can you amplify what you share to become so let's say you learn like a really. let's say you learn how to do like. I know you're doing data science and maybe you're putting a ui on top of a data science problem or something like that or how okay let's do stage maker so let's say you're doing some machine learning right. you're learning to do some data science right and you build this really cool thing on stage maker, so if it was me, I would, I would not only do it for class, but I would be like. Okay, I built this really cool. thing i'm going to have really great documentation i'm going to do a blog made a video then i'm going to go to the stage maker Community forum, then i'm going to start posting about it, then i'm going to try to reach out to whoever's leading that community. make them aware of it, and then try to drive more visibility into that so you're trying to build up like. you're taking something that Okay, you could have just learned it and then took the test and then forgot about it but you're you're you're you could take it so much farther. So that kind of thing will be built around a lot of relationships so there's a lot of that stuff they don't teach you in school, and I think if you do those kind of things you can. You can far outpaced your peers, especially once you get to the point where you want to land your dream job you can engineer yourself into your dream job. Right, so you can literally craft these things when I hire people. I look at their github I look at what they're talking about what they do, like everyone could say stuff on resumes but then, if I see like a YouTube video and like blogs, and their github projects, and I can see all this things and they're not just like. Oh, look at my resume cool I took this basic class whatever like I really don't care. Even if you have a 4.0 i'll hire somebody that never even went to college that literally is just like out there and showing the proof in the pudding not not not somebody that just says they're good at something so anyways. that's what I would do different and that's what I would encourage throughout college is building connections and building up credibility and engineering yourself, while you're doing that. So, like, I understand, like. large scale application. databases. yeah you could you could I could just share a couple things that i'm building right now that are small scale, maybe gives you some ideas. Sure yeah so one, let me see if I can share my. yep just give you a call to work. So even even you can create something like this. So of course I use tg cloud because it's free it's easy to use, so feel free to use tg cloud it's Nice because you can do a lot of different things and engage, you can you can interface with it and you don't have to say anything out. But this is wait, the system, the one. Let me to. log into this one, this is my linkedin graph so this one, this one you guys could do even it's pretty straightforward basically what I wanted to do is, I wanted to see all the interconnections between some of my colleagues at work. So I went to design schema so under the hood of linkedin as they're actually doing this, if you go to like your people, and you go to my network and you go to connections. trying to find, where it says like first degree second degree and stuff. But you guys know what i'm you know i'm talking about right first degrees here this first degree second degree third degree, so this means john's connected to. Dan and the first degree and then Dan might have a friend, but i'm not connected to them so there's a second degree and then there's third degree, so one of the neat things you can do with this and pretty much with all. All your social media is you can go to settings and privacy and then you can go to data privacy and get a copy of your data and then you can grab your connections. So you can fetch it. And then, what we're doing was so we had a list of like I think there's 20 other people, and we had them drop their connections, and so the data file, you can get the company, the position and person and see if you can explore ground. So you know here here's a here's a bunch of different companies yeah you can just click on where's this person work. This person works at whatever company that's called. This is the position. Alright, so and nobody else woman design magazine, so you just start crawling us there's probably more than one account manager has a role so let's see. yeah so you can you can start to see different different you know different views here if i'm just manually creating. crawling us, but the things I wanted to do was how can I find who's connected to who maybe by a company. So I just wrote wrote some basic queries like get connections of a person, so this one, if I do. See somebody I know. Now, I can see who's connected to my work with Dan mccurry who's an optimum employee. And then, how do I take this further one of the cool things that tiger APP has is that you can get everything as a as a rest endpoint so, then what we did was and I don't have the shame, I have it open just a second, let me pull something up. to pull this up so, then I wanted to put a gui on it, because there's I don't want people to interface with the database, I just wanted them to have something. super simple so i'm just going to click on this. yeah graphical user interface, so we built. This is this is called a read ash is the the tooling This allows you to build like a bar charts line charts pie charts and all those kind of things. And, and this in a table, of course, so that queries feed into this table so it's taking json and converting it to a data frame, but then I can search, you know I can be like Okay, who all works at silence. You know that that i'm connected to so who's connected to who I know that works at this company so that's like one small use case the other we're doing some other stuff if you guys are familiar discord. yeah yeah we're building one one of our use cases and I don't know if I have it here. Is we're basically pulling all of our discord information out then running nlp through the discord so, then we can see what people are talking about and then building a knowledge graph so we can basically. And then you can put a chat Bot, on top of that, or do whatever you want or put you can put a dashboard on to it and see what you know how many times people talk about a certain let's say Python how many times that people say Python and community. So you can put like analytical dashboard with your with your with your data from discord that's another sort of side project and we're doing that, beyond discord we're going into discord reddit. We were doing news post so we're basically what our thought was for this little side project was can we build like. What we know about ourselves, but then also what we know about other people or other communities so like competitors of analysis tool, so we can analyze other other communities, so you can go to. This Community where are they talking about maybe some news post come up What were they talking about are putting this all this interconnected graph solution. So that's another small one here we're making this graph specifically is pretty simplistic it's just got users and assets and tags basically we're building a clone of pinterest is what what this this this one that i'm currently on. So yeah you could I mean you could you could there's so many different things, and so many different ways that you could use graph. These are just some of the things that i'm actively working on right now. Hopefully that answered the question but yeah you could sky's the limit for different ideas. yeah another actually another resource that you guys might like. This was developed by one of. Our interns as a student as a freshman. it's really cool because it walks you through every single step and. Have you guys ever heard of plot Lee or dash i'm assuming everyone knows Python right. yeah yeah. Okay cool So if you know Python you'll be superstars. This one. And here. So you can with politely politely and dash so partly as a visualization component library bar charts line charts all those kind of chart charity things. dash allows you to put things into. If you've heard of streamline dashes like a dashboard in tool, but a little bit more advanced, you can do a lot more different things like multi pages and and whatnot so Python based So if you know pipeline, you can build these pretty fast. This one this one's like healthcare data this one's coven 19 data, this one is movie I be ID bm, I think, is what it is, or this one. One of our developer advocates put a bunch of arduino sensors in his room, it was sensing different data streaming wait, maybe not this one, one of these that he was doing was streaming data from sensors. But all of these have full notebooks you can literally run through this and recreate it, but then what this Quick Start guide also allows you to do. is literally go see sorry there's to start the Quick Start is like just going to the basics, the adventure is more like the storytelling. Put a whole story together about how how you can navigate every single step and use this this library so everything from like nav bars to sidebars and whatnot so i'll drop this into the. chat but the cool thing about visualization ones is these usually resonate pretty well on like your linkedin and whatnot every time I posted I get like. 200 300 likes a lot of people like visualization stuff so what i'll do sometimes is i'll create like an APP and then i'll take a video of it and they'll convert it to a gift and then put it into a linkedin to share. Well, what is the name of that Google blog posts, you said that like is like things strings. Oh things not strings. Okay okay. yeah. I can you want me to share have an old back if maybe for those people that aren't familiar with. Some of the things. So I do a lot of presentations and so I have a lot of these decks. So I think there's an interesting one. yeah I can start here so here's a bunch of different like graph use cases and he's have different people are using us so like Jaguar Land Rover is really tracing their whole supply chain. You know let's say a ship gets stuck in a canal, what does that impact on all the different parts and things across all of our products and services. You have like wish COM that's looking at transaction history. You have networking operationally you have everything from like deep link analytics so doing multi hops tracing that's another thing like doing doing deep transactional traces. A lot of people aren't using a tie graph for the cool one that, I mean knowledge graphs are pretty that's like Google, you know search knowledge graphs that's that's pretty traditional the coolest one that's not listed on here, let me get seeping into it. So, most of the customers have like this, but these are powered by. The powered by a. graph analytics oh yeah here, this might be helpful for some people. So, like. This is this is basically what that sample project was doing so, I have a bunch of connections, if you had your all your connections interconnected, this is what it look like, if you visualize sell your stuff so that's really what's under the hood. And this was just me breaking it Okay, if I was going to break build linkedin graph How would I deconstruct it, these are all the different components, so if you start thinking like graph this is how I look. At these different things, and then here's the part that we just talked about having first degree second degree third degree connections and then you run different algorithms that create fields, so a lot of different social social. Social platforms do stuff like this. This is going into another one, so how to do recommendation engines it's using cosine similarity algorithms. Everything you do is tracked everything you do, as far as a click hover over how long you're on a page. All these different things are metrics that you're that you can store into your Meta graph and you can do you can use to to create a product recommendations, of course, we talked about. Google and things not strings blog 2015 pretty sure I think that's when it came out that there may be most famous algorithms called page rank. So pagerank is just calculating the influence score. From vertex vertex I think now they change their their algorithm of how they derive the content. But that's what they used to use, and that was based off Larry page, this is my favorite one and coolest one is they're doing real real real time. transaction energy loads so they're like analyzing the integrated system at in real time and to redistribute or like. Reporting on all these different you know substations to this, and this, and so they can recalibrate you know what's what's happening in real time across the energy grid system. which I think is critical, this is the supply chain back thinking about Land Rover Jaguar Land Rover so you have. You know suppliers parts features and cars, so you might have features that are tied to multiple different parts, you know what happens if this part doesn't get somewhere because of that, what are the, what are the cut conversations effects from that. These are, this is more like anti resolution fraud so you're looking at you know the users with maybe the same IP same same address maybe they try to log into a different account but they're at the same IP you can track all those different things and do traces. This one's really cool for into machine learning Ai, how can you do. graph based future generation, so you know traditional features, you have the tabular structure, you can look at the structure of the data and the interconnectedness of the data to to drive new feature or new features, they can use in your machine learning algorithm. Know what's the difference between like a good phone and a bad phone in this. yeah yeah so you know this, this is actually implementation at China mobile Have you ever had do you have an iPhone that says spam, sometimes it pops up. yeah it's like scam likely or something like that. yeah so what that that's doing right here that's that's basically what it is it's popping that button up and doing it based off these features so. The bad phone gets a lot of rejections like people don't answer just rejected right when it's so that's one thing, the number of callbacks nobody's calling back that phone so bad phone if there's a short call duration, so you can pick up in these like. Maybe it's some automated message usually then then people hang up right away so there's all of these characteristics about. Bad phone even average distance so like this phone isn't kindness one that's kindness one now let's go to the other side. You have a good phone maybe this is uconn your mom your mom's Klein your dad your dad's calling your. aunt or whatever you know there's these interconnection of groups of phone calls going on there's also long durations of calls there's also numerous calls, you probably call your mom or dad grandpa a lot of different times and usually they have connections and there's. A stable group of like phone numbers yours calling So these are these are features that I think there was like 250 features that they generated I don't know how many of them, they use but. yeah, this is a deep link. And you know how you you weren't able to download the data for that linkedin you're able to just like go in and download, are there any other data sources were like just for different applications where you could just go and get that. um yeah there's. You can comfort pretty much anything that's in tabular format to to to graph format, so one way, I would, if you're if you're interested or thinking about doing that is you. can go to the learning sessions that are going on right now the fourth one is just about to come out. So if you go tiger graph i'd watch these two videos because my my coworker is putting together for a brand new like if you're brand new to tiger graph how to start thinking about graph. It would be part one of this graph one on one so it's just just came out recently in Part Two part three, is coming out tomorrow. But it's taking somebody from the mindset of I have never heard of graph and now I have some tabular data that I want to explore so whatever that tabular data is. How do I start to think and graph and interconnect that in graph and how do I derive what I want to drive out of it so that's that's what I would recommend is watching this part one and part two. Okay. But yeah so like in the past we've had some interns that wanted to engineer themselves into working at. One of our customers places, so you did a lot of projects that were pertaining to finance of fraud, and so, you know as as an intern he created all these different Open Source projects blogs and videos and then he. Basically, went to the hiring manager at this this bank and said. They were there recruiting actively at the time and said yeah i'd love to work with you and and then they said yeah we really want you, and then he was negotiating his salary as an intern to basically double his salary. Because he had all the proof it wasn't like he said Oh, I worked on paragraph on his resume it was literally like. Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so you know he engineered himself into that that kind of position but that's what you could do as well, so like if you wanted to. work at tesla or work at wherever How would you engineer yourself into to be in that position, and you might need somebody that can help guide you or be a mentor as well. yeah I think that's an interesting concept, just like with the engineering yourself that you can it's not like you can just start off with nothing and still just do different things to build yourself up in that way. yeah yeah you just you just ask yourself, you try to figure out like where where you can. provide the most like, how can you how can you demonstrate that you can provide value in that perspective space that you want to be in. And then it's all about building up that and then driving that awareness so like maybe hopefully it maybe they even reach out because they see that you became an influencer in that space, because you were doing a bunch of. a bunch of things along that journey to build that influence, maybe. I don't know bank people go to a specific meetup and there you know you start to go and short hair stuff there and. This VP of this executive bank is at that meetup and they saw your presentation, they want to give you a job now so it's just about putting yourself out there and engineering yourself and different positions. cool. Do you guys have any other questions. yeah. i'm Danny and I was wondering like you keep saying. How do I, like. Well, what makes you have to you have to ask yourself what makes you passionate you know what what what excites you what kind of things. are of interest to you so like let's say I love to play virtual reality, I like to do virtual out of games, or something like that. You know, and I want to be a virtual I like I want to work at oculus you know how can I engineer my projects and different things. and add a unique perspective that maybe they're not thinking about and then, how do I get in front of that community so when you want to like. So if I was doing vr ar I might do some different hackathons and then I might share what I did, and then tag oculus and stuff and then go to their community and share it try to find key influencers maybe even my local area. Even even been to the point where i'm going to be like I find somebody at oculus that lives in Minnesota and I connect with them on linkedin and say hey i'd love to go and grab a cup of coffee, you know, so you can you can you can do all these. Active things not and and try to build that up versus being like Oh, I always wanted to work at oculus go through school and then you. And then you got like oh I got my resume here you go and they'd be like I don't care about you, I don't know who you are you're just another resume like, how do you how do you not be that so like I guarantee you if, like. If you wanted to work at tiger, if you want to work at whatever company if you're doing all those different things they're going to be taking notice. It wasn't me who offered a job, to share it was our CEO and our CEO is like look at this person creating all this stuff because she was sharing all this. cool things on linkedin social media was in the forums, creating all these different things doing hackathons Vance that the the CEO said hey, we need to hire this person I said. All right, let's do it, you know and so she got a job right so that's that's what you need to do is is think through that and they don't teach you at that school, at least not the school, I went to. You did the vr game. But I don't really have like a vr. want to do something. What I said just if you don't know what you want to do yeah. um so one thing I would do is maybe start to explore like a kid so let's go back to oculus I have no idea anything about their Community so i'm just making all this stuff up. I will start to get like a deep dive into their Community what's resonating what are some like new product. Maybe even not start to think of like what are their new product releases and might, might I might start targeting like. Building a how to video with this new feature that they just released because that's always going to be hot like they're trying to get out the new features. And then i'd start to get my presence known and then I would start to just explore different things and come up with unique things in that space so maybe like Okay, how do you do, even if you wanted to combine air and graph, how do you do like. So we're talking to unity, right now, and how do we do, how do you do analytics on all the actions and behaviors and. People and users and stuff like that all that data is stored into a big graph and then you can run all the analytics that you went on to it so maybe you do something unique like that I do include vr. Video games with with analytics are you know you have to you have to just try to like feel it out go to you have to first go out there and try to explore. And then see where what what interests you or what what yeah but but a good way, though, is is if there's new features that come out and you start being the first one to shirt like share how to do stuff with those features that company is going to take notice, you know. that's that's one thing you could do. huh. yeah yeah I mean you have to really put your put yourself out there, since not asking simple in the way i've always given yeah. always be like give give give give and people are going to start taking notice of it but you're given like strategic like you have a reason why you're doing it. Thank you yeah. Any last minute questions. would be are correct. me. No, I don't work at a vr company I work at a graph database company. name is here. Oh, I was just giving I was just gonna example, so we were talking about how to engineer yourself and I just took a random a random company and was walking through how I would engineer myself and if I was going after that perspective john or role or company I got confused for a second. Sorry. I just heard that example. You could do that for any example, though. The big bank healthcare company, you know just engineer yourself doing strategic things to put your put yourself out there and getting visibility. Oh, I have like I kind of have an interesting question, what do you think, or what do you think are the next like big upcoming technologies that you feel I don't feel like are still pretty new but there they have like a huge potential to just. expanded become like pop things in CS. See yes um well. yeah they I mean quantum is definitely like the fringe of possible and impossible I think they know if they can never figure out quantum to work at scale. That would be a pretty interesting, one that would have ripple effects across many industries, you know what if you had quantum processors for cryptocurrency or quantum whatever processors for math equations and everybody can have those at home. Oh, one of the I guess it's not really a technology but it's an interesting it's an interesting thought exercises. there's a I don't know the exact number, but like billions at least a billion, I think, or more of people don't have Internet right now right there's just not the infrastructure, the network. spacex is coming out my parents have spacex at their house, so they just meld know are shooting up to sound like a 200 megs. Now if everyone has Internet, what are the, what are the, what are the conversations of that how am I market shifts happen that might be. That might be an interesting exercise but yeah graph that everyone's looking for different ways to do analytics in the grass face graph neural nets are getting pretty popular dnn. there's all there's every day there's a new gbt three new you know new language models and stuff like that, so one shot learning language models, I think there's always going to be a need for analytics. there's not enough data graph data scientist that's a short ever there's a lot of Python developers, but you know people that know know how to do these. Different data structures um yeah I would say. I would say. Another one would be. Digital twin is sort of a weird one in the sense that they're trying to. Do predictions about different things based off of other things, and so, if you look up digital trend twin you might find a lot of different things, but digital twin in the sense of users user applications, so that could be into recommendation engines. Digital twins in the sense of like medical means, how can you how can you find somebody that's super similar to yourself and then. You can make that better drug recommendations or you can run different analytics. But yeah blockchain technology is still have a long ways to go they're pretty pretty new. Then. there's a there's there's a lot of different ones, I would just I would, if I was you i'd follow gartner. The emerging trends and that changes every so that's when we were working at this emerging tech working on quantum Ai de de de de de we're following the gartner emerging trends so look up that it's called the hype cycle and i'll show you all the new things on the cusp of possibilities. Oh Okay, I never heard of that. yeah right chicken up. like this. yeah gartner and look at here i'll just share it. So this is this where I would go to like. So it looks like. This thing. So these are the emerging technologies. Oh, and F tease Ai driven augmentation quantum machine learning. So we can go back and see what the previous ones where it's a little hard to see carbon based trends transitions bring your own identity as citizen point digital twin here's digital twin they're talking about that. yeah so you can you can start to see data fabrics. The gardener has a lot of great information 2009 they're talking about five g still. But this is a great place to to look at the cusp of nascar 3D printing. flying a time as cars say that's more than 10 years from now. Low earth orbit satellites systems there, we do not the spacex so it was that one five years, I think that that that emerged a little bit. earlier. So yeah that's what I would look at and follow those reports partners really good at submitting those on what's what's new. Are you still working on that jarvis thing. I haven't I haven't for a while, actually, it was talking to a university that they wanted to incorporate graph and virtual reality like to walk through like the Meta. an. And I was suggested doing the jarvis project with them, but I haven't had enough resources to actually build my own jarvis type project, because the ultimate goal would be like, just as you were talking to jarvis. You could use alexa and then maybe some like virtual reality on mentation who like walk through information and stuff. Just never had the chance to to to focus on it so but, hopefully, hopefully, I can propose this idea to this university I think it's an Ohio. That they'll have a bunch of students that could work on building something along that lines because and will just help guide them mentor them along MySpace because that's what she wants to do something vr with graph so that was pretty cool. Any other any other questions. guys any questions audience. No, I think we're good. yeah thanks for thanks for coming here and spending the time just talk about those then provide your your thoughts and insights on things. yeah yeah and feel free to Ping me on discord if you want like hey. i'm thinking about doing this, could you have do you have any advice, how to approach that. You know, or if you have a dream job and you want us to somebody else to drift off of how you can successfully get yourself in there, let me know more than willing to to help coach or mentor. Oh, I actually had a question, so I was thinking about doing like a graph database it's like trying to model like something about students like sleep better or something. But I wasn't really sure how to go about that, but I was just thinking like for like I don't know how I would like collect data or anything like that, so I wanted to ask you, like how, how do you like get data for like these kind of projects. yeah sometimes on kaggle we've done fitbit data with tiger graph at my previous company adopt them and basically we just asked everyone to share their fitbit data, just like you would share your linkedin data. And so we did a data dump of their their data. That my coworker is actually the primary. The my coworkers the primary driver of that that initiative and that product, so if that's something that really interests you i'll tell them to to to chat with you, and he can tell you all about how to structure it up for fitbit data. yeah. I don't think there's many blogs on that either So if you create some can share it with everybody. right for like fitbit data yeah I haven't I haven't seen I he created an iot you create an iot graph on if you go to YouTube and then go to tie graph and then look up iot I think there's some iot based stuff he created. And, but it was it was more arm, you know, like whether or is more like temperature and humidity sensing but I mean the same concept, you know streaming data. yeah. yeah I think all. Right, thank you. All right, it's good to see you guys. \""

       "Five four. cool. All right, well. Thank you all for being here and thanks for having me as a guest at this this this meetup here and yeah I can give you a background about myself, you know how how. My career has landed me to lead a developer relations team at Silicon Valley startup and I work in Minnesota, but I can tell you my journey of how I I now work for one of the hottest startups startups in Silicon Valley. And I can give you my deep background and also how features can be kicked off in the beginning, you know so let's see where I where do I want to get started um. yeah i'll start with my i'll start with my work history so. I I joined the army National Guard before I went to college my my i've always been interested in computers and understand how computers work so when I joined. The military I wanted to graduate debt free was my goal from college, I did I don't want to have any debt when I graduated so that was my primary reason for for joining the military and. get some free education, so I joined the military what I was doing was a computer networking engineer I go out in the middle of nowhere shoot up to a satellite grabbing up link deploy network and programs routers and switches so very network focused. and building up so you'd have like nothing you'd be out in the middle of a cornfield and there's nothing there you bring all your trucks and your tents and whatnot and your computers and. Your networking stacks and you, we have to set up the base of operations and then by the end of US setting this up now you have computers and phones and whatnot. So I got a lot of clearances and I had my secrets cured clans by the Department of Defense and all these networking certifications So when I went through college I tested out of some classes, because they're so boring. And I was never a big fan of school but i'm a very passionate person about learning I love education, I love learning I love being creative. But school was not my favorite thing to be honest and so anyways yeah so I went to I went to mankato State University just because my My family has a lot of history down there, and my grandpa was professor and my parents went there so that's where i'd family nearby. So I went I went there that degree and CS basically with focus on networking security, and you know I had a background in that, and then I, my first job as an intern was working at united health group. I don't know if you've heard of united health group or optum. They have a really cool program it's called the technology development program so we're one of the pioneers to this this new program that they're trying to create now if you go to college anywhere in Minnesota you'll probably have these. Optimum recruiters telling you all about the Program. Which is a rotational program so I got in there as an intern I was a super intern I was. Harry had, I had a higher clearance level than everybody in the $6 billion data centers I can go into any server rooms swap different things out figure different things. And yeah I started doing networking got really bored really fast of doing that work and engineering a big giant company had the opportunity to. join this sort of creative startup incubator inside this giant company called optimum and it was very. Very business model focused I don't know if you know the lean methodology it's a great book if you if you haven't read that before. Running lean talks about how you can create a startup and what steps you need to take so we we follow this methodology. I think a great example of that would be like uber you know cars existed phones existed, it was just reimagining airbnb another great one. it's reimagining the way that the business, you know, using what's out there reimagining the way a business operates. And so we're doing that, from a healthcare perspective, so I was a founder in residence at this this startup incubator. And then, in August 2016 we started seeing emerging technologies really disrupt different industries. And this is everything from Ai technologies natural language trusts machine learning deep learning computer vision, the list of Ai stuff goes on and on how blockchain technologies Internet of Things quantum computing and graph databases. And so, for coming from the networking world I lean heavy into into the into the graph space interconnected data and the more I was in this is where this is where we started to. formulate the futurist academy is I was doing a lot of things where i'd take my education about blockchain or Ai natural language processing. graph databases and I start to go to Community events in different schools, I went to EDEN prairie and that's where I met. There was an ios developer team and that's where I met real hon anyways I was asked to come to the EDEN prairie school and give a talk about blockchain, and so we launched a cryptocurrency live in class on the test net. So we talked about how blockchains work and how cryptocurrency works, but I was doing a lot of these different events, where I was engaging with different. Different students in different meetups and different things, and people kept asking how can we be part of this, how can we be part of something where we're connected Community that is. Constantly learning, and so the reason I wanted to also create futures camp is not only to create that house, but also for the ability. to discover new passions and learn from one another, also I hated school, and so I you know I thought. there's so many opportunities that you can engineer yourself if you just put your mind to it and being. passionate and learning about new things, and you can engineer yourself your own opportunity that you might want to do so if you wanted to work at tesla, how do you get there, if you want to work at the neuro link project, how can you get there. How can you engineer yourself into that kind of position. So anyways that's how a feature set Kevin was really created was not by my thought of creating a features coming it was more based off demand of other people wanting to be part of a community that intermingled. So then yeah I got I got a call from tiger graph and they're like we want you to be a technology evangelist i'm from Minnesota I have no idea all the terminology from. Silicon Valley, so I was like what's the technology evangelist they're like we would just want you to do what you're doing but do it for us do meetups do events do blogs do videos do engagements help. Help other developers understand the technology, and so, two years ago I jumped off of usg after working there for six and a half years. and made the transition to to tiger graph and so now i've been here for for two years and training, training people up nurturing the commute I run the Community for for tiger graph we do a lot of different events and. and challenges and do a lot of Community engagement a lot Open Source projects my favorite thing to do is is. Share other people's projects in the Community, so if I see something cool on github or somebody reaches out, I always like to to advocate and share their blogs and get it repost it on social media. But yeah that's that's a crash course in my my life and my background and networking engineer to founder and residents to building out emerging tech lab. To doing a lot of Community engagement to ultimately being a developer, leaving the developer relations team here at tiger graph so. Any any questions on the journey. yeah go ahead. I was what. How is working for tech graph it's it's awesome. yeah no it's it's um if you're not familiar, I mean so graph databases power pretty much everything, today you just might not know know about it. And Google Google declared a blog that says things not strings if you ever want to look it up. And it was their declaration of them using graph to interconnect all the data together so that uncanny ability. When you're when you're browsing different things and ads pop up. that's because they're doing all of these different things that are all interconnected and that could includes not only your behaviors but other people's like similar people like you and their behaviors. If you look at the algorithms for netflix or HBO is a customer of ours, how you're able to recommend content that that's powered by graph under the hood of linkedin is powered by graph Facebook under the hood of pinterest even huge companies doing analytical. Like way fer, for example, there's so many different applications of graph and it's weird because, not a lot of people understand that, but I think what I love about tiger graph. Is that there's not many tools out there that are for scale that are make this technology available for everybody, so uber and all these companies have their own proprietary graph solutions. That they home grown and built what tiger raft neo for Jay Cambridge semantics, some of them are labeled property graphs and some of them are already F graphs like star dog. But what these technology companies do is enable everybody as a developer and customers and consumers, whatever you want to call them. To have that power of these big giant tech companies, so my favorite part, though, is tiger graph is. We feel we're far ahead of other other companies and so it's cool just to be at a company that just as sort of a leader in that space we haven't been around the longest but we definitely have the fastest technology platform so. yeah other than that the people are great the jobs great I love helping people I it's it's a work hard play it play hard. work hard work hard play hard anyways we do a lot of different things. And leadership's great as far as giving us full. I wouldn't say control but but gives us the breathing space to allow us to innovate and do the things that we want to do that really are targeted towards. Whatever we're trying to drive in my in my perspective, i'm trying to grow adoption i'm trying to get more people to understand how to use the technology. and grow the Community, so I do a lot of different events, so I love, a lot of things yeah. I guess, I guess, one question i've asked is just from your perspective, what do you feel are the main things to take away from college, other than just learning. Just just like learning the general topics that you have in your classes like what are the main things you can take advantage in that experience. um so one thing I would have done differently in college if I, and one thing that they never teach you in college is. they'll give you the book, but what you want to do there's two things you want to build influence and you want to build connections Those are the two things i'll get you anywhere in life. So building influence is done by sharing right So if you learn something in school, besides just the school project, how can you apply what you learned and build something cool and then share it share it on github share it through. share it through blogs or videos but, more importantly, how can you take, how can you amplify what you share to become so let's say you learn like a really. let's say you learn how to do like. I know you're doing data science and maybe you're putting a ui on top of a data science problem or something like that or how okay let's do stage maker so let's say you're doing some machine learning right. you're learning to do some data science right and you build this really cool thing on stage maker, so if it was me, I would, I would not only do it for class, but I would be like. Okay, I built this really cool. thing i'm going to have really great documentation i'm going to do a blog made a video then i'm going to go to the stage maker Community forum, then i'm going to start posting about it, then i'm going to try to reach out to whoever's leading that community. make them aware of it, and then try to drive more visibility into that so you're trying to build up like. you're taking something that Okay, you could have just learned it and then took the test and then forgot about it but you're you're you're you could take it so much farther. So that kind of thing will be built around a lot of relationships so there's a lot of that stuff they don't teach you in school, and I think if you do those kind of things you can. You can far outpaced your peers, especially once you get to the point where you want to land your dream job you can engineer yourself into your dream job. Right, so you can literally craft these things when I hire people. I look at their github I look at what they're talking about what they do, like everyone could say stuff on resumes but then, if I see like a YouTube video and like blogs, and their github projects, and I can see all this things and they're not just like. Oh, look at my resume cool I took this basic class whatever like I really don't care. Even if you have a 4.0 i'll hire somebody that never even went to college that literally is just like out there and showing the proof in the pudding not not not somebody that just says they're good at something so anyways. that's what I would do different and that's what I would encourage throughout college is building connections and building up credibility and engineering yourself, while you're doing that. So, like, I understand, like. large scale application. databases. yeah you could you could I could just share a couple things that i'm building right now that are small scale, maybe gives you some ideas. Sure yeah so one, let me see if I can share my. yep just give you a call to work. So even even you can create something like this. So of course I use tg cloud because it's free it's easy to use, so feel free to use tg cloud it's Nice because you can do a lot of different things and engage, you can you can interface with it and you don't have to say anything out. But this is wait, the system, the one. Let me to. log into this one, this is my linkedin graph so this one, this one you guys could do even it's pretty straightforward basically what I wanted to do is, I wanted to see all the interconnections between some of my colleagues at work. So I went to design schema so under the hood of linkedin as they're actually doing this, if you go to like your people, and you go to my network and you go to connections. trying to find, where it says like first degree second degree and stuff. But you guys know what i'm you know i'm talking about right first degrees here this first degree second degree third degree, so this means john's connected to. Dan and the first degree and then Dan might have a friend, but i'm not connected to them so there's a second degree and then there's third degree, so one of the neat things you can do with this and pretty much with all. All your social media is you can go to settings and privacy and then you can go to data privacy and get a copy of your data and then you can grab your connections. So you can fetch it. And then, what we're doing was so we had a list of like I think there's 20 other people, and we had them drop their connections, and so the data file, you can get the company, the position and person and see if you can explore ground. So you know here here's a here's a bunch of different companies yeah you can just click on where's this person work. This person works at whatever company that's called. This is the position. Alright, so and nobody else woman design magazine, so you just start crawling us there's probably more than one account manager has a role so let's see. yeah so you can you can start to see different different you know different views here if i'm just manually creating. crawling us, but the things I wanted to do was how can I find who's connected to who maybe by a company. So I just wrote wrote some basic queries like get connections of a person, so this one, if I do. See somebody I know. Now, I can see who's connected to my work with Dan mccurry who's an optimum employee. And then, how do I take this further one of the cool things that tiger APP has is that you can get everything as a as a rest endpoint so, then what we did was and I don't have the shame, I have it open just a second, let me pull something up. to pull this up so, then I wanted to put a gui on it, because there's I don't want people to interface with the database, I just wanted them to have something. super simple so i'm just going to click on this. yeah graphical user interface, so we built. This is this is called a read ash is the the tooling This allows you to build like a bar charts line charts pie charts and all those kind of things. And, and this in a table, of course, so that queries feed into this table so it's taking json and converting it to a data frame, but then I can search, you know I can be like Okay, who all works at silence. You know that that i'm connected to so who's connected to who I know that works at this company so that's like one small use case the other we're doing some other stuff if you guys are familiar discord. yeah yeah we're building one one of our use cases and I don't know if I have it here. Is we're basically pulling all of our discord information out then running nlp through the discord so, then we can see what people are talking about and then building a knowledge graph so we can basically. And then you can put a chat Bot, on top of that, or do whatever you want or put you can put a dashboard on to it and see what you know how many times people talk about a certain let's say Python how many times that people say Python and community. So you can put like analytical dashboard with your with your with your data from discord that's another sort of side project and we're doing that, beyond discord we're going into discord reddit. We were doing news post so we're basically what our thought was for this little side project was can we build like. What we know about ourselves, but then also what we know about other people or other communities so like competitors of analysis tool, so we can analyze other other communities, so you can go to. This Community where are they talking about maybe some news post come up What were they talking about are putting this all this interconnected graph solution. So that's another small one here we're making this graph specifically is pretty simplistic it's just got users and assets and tags basically we're building a clone of pinterest is what what this this this one that i'm currently on. So yeah you could I mean you could you could there's so many different things, and so many different ways that you could use graph. These are just some of the things that i'm actively working on right now. Hopefully that answered the question but yeah you could sky's the limit for different ideas. yeah another actually another resource that you guys might like. This was developed by one of. Our interns as a student as a freshman. it's really cool because it walks you through every single step and. Have you guys ever heard of plot Lee or dash i'm assuming everyone knows Python right. yeah yeah. Okay cool So if you know Python you'll be superstars. This one. And here. So you can with politely politely and dash so partly as a visualization component library bar charts line charts all those kind of chart charity things. dash allows you to put things into. If you've heard of streamline dashes like a dashboard in tool, but a little bit more advanced, you can do a lot more different things like multi pages and and whatnot so Python based So if you know pipeline, you can build these pretty fast. This one this one's like healthcare data this one's coven 19 data, this one is movie I be ID bm, I think, is what it is, or this one. One of our developer advocates put a bunch of arduino sensors in his room, it was sensing different data streaming wait, maybe not this one, one of these that he was doing was streaming data from sensors. But all of these have full notebooks you can literally run through this and recreate it, but then what this Quick Start guide also allows you to do. is literally go see sorry there's to start the Quick Start is like just going to the basics, the adventure is more like the storytelling. Put a whole story together about how how you can navigate every single step and use this this library so everything from like nav bars to sidebars and whatnot so i'll drop this into the. chat but the cool thing about visualization ones is these usually resonate pretty well on like your linkedin and whatnot every time I posted I get like. 200 300 likes a lot of people like visualization stuff so what i'll do sometimes is i'll create like an APP and then i'll take a video of it and they'll convert it to a gift and then put it into a linkedin to share. Well, what is the name of that Google blog posts, you said that like is like things strings. Oh things not strings. Okay okay. yeah. I can you want me to share have an old back if maybe for those people that aren't familiar with. Some of the things. So I do a lot of presentations and so I have a lot of these decks. So I think there's an interesting one. yeah I can start here so here's a bunch of different like graph use cases and he's have different people are using us so like Jaguar Land Rover is really tracing their whole supply chain. You know let's say a ship gets stuck in a canal, what does that impact on all the different parts and things across all of our products and services. You have like wish COM that's looking at transaction history. You have networking operationally you have everything from like deep link analytics so doing multi hops tracing that's another thing like doing doing deep transactional traces. A lot of people aren't using a tie graph for the cool one that, I mean knowledge graphs are pretty that's like Google, you know search knowledge graphs that's that's pretty traditional the coolest one that's not listed on here, let me get seeping into it. So, most of the customers have like this, but these are powered by. The powered by a. graph analytics oh yeah here, this might be helpful for some people. So, like. This is this is basically what that sample project was doing so, I have a bunch of connections, if you had your all your connections interconnected, this is what it look like, if you visualize sell your stuff so that's really what's under the hood. And this was just me breaking it Okay, if I was going to break build linkedin graph How would I deconstruct it, these are all the different components, so if you start thinking like graph this is how I look. At these different things, and then here's the part that we just talked about having first degree second degree third degree connections and then you run different algorithms that create fields, so a lot of different social social. Social platforms do stuff like this. This is going into another one, so how to do recommendation engines it's using cosine similarity algorithms. Everything you do is tracked everything you do, as far as a click hover over how long you're on a page. All these different things are metrics that you're that you can store into your Meta graph and you can do you can use to to create a product recommendations, of course, we talked about. Google and things not strings blog 2015 pretty sure I think that's when it came out that there may be most famous algorithms called page rank. So pagerank is just calculating the influence score. From vertex vertex I think now they change their their algorithm of how they derive the content. But that's what they used to use, and that was based off Larry page, this is my favorite one and coolest one is they're doing real real real time. transaction energy loads so they're like analyzing the integrated system at in real time and to redistribute or like. Reporting on all these different you know substations to this, and this, and so they can recalibrate you know what's what's happening in real time across the energy grid system. which I think is critical, this is the supply chain back thinking about Land Rover Jaguar Land Rover so you have. You know suppliers parts features and cars, so you might have features that are tied to multiple different parts, you know what happens if this part doesn't get somewhere because of that, what are the, what are the cut conversations effects from that. These are, this is more like anti resolution fraud so you're looking at you know the users with maybe the same IP same same address maybe they try to log into a different account but they're at the same IP you can track all those different things and do traces. This one's really cool for into machine learning Ai, how can you do. graph based future generation, so you know traditional features, you have the tabular structure, you can look at the structure of the data and the interconnectedness of the data to to drive new feature or new features, they can use in your machine learning algorithm. Know what's the difference between like a good phone and a bad phone in this. yeah yeah so you know this, this is actually implementation at China mobile Have you ever had do you have an iPhone that says spam, sometimes it pops up. yeah it's like scam likely or something like that. yeah so what that that's doing right here that's that's basically what it is it's popping that button up and doing it based off these features so. The bad phone gets a lot of rejections like people don't answer just rejected right when it's so that's one thing, the number of callbacks nobody's calling back that phone so bad phone if there's a short call duration, so you can pick up in these like. Maybe it's some automated message usually then then people hang up right away so there's all of these characteristics about. Bad phone even average distance so like this phone isn't kindness one that's kindness one now let's go to the other side. You have a good phone maybe this is uconn your mom your mom's Klein your dad your dad's calling your. aunt or whatever you know there's these interconnection of groups of phone calls going on there's also long durations of calls there's also numerous calls, you probably call your mom or dad grandpa a lot of different times and usually they have connections and there's. A stable group of like phone numbers yours calling So these are these are features that I think there was like 250 features that they generated I don't know how many of them, they use but. yeah, this is a deep link. And you know how you you weren't able to download the data for that linkedin you're able to just like go in and download, are there any other data sources were like just for different applications where you could just go and get that. um yeah there's. You can comfort pretty much anything that's in tabular format to to to graph format, so one way, I would, if you're if you're interested or thinking about doing that is you. can go to the learning sessions that are going on right now the fourth one is just about to come out. So if you go tiger graph i'd watch these two videos because my my coworker is putting together for a brand new like if you're brand new to tiger graph how to start thinking about graph. It would be part one of this graph one on one so it's just just came out recently in Part Two part three, is coming out tomorrow. But it's taking somebody from the mindset of I have never heard of graph and now I have some tabular data that I want to explore so whatever that tabular data is. How do I start to think and graph and interconnect that in graph and how do I derive what I want to drive out of it so that's that's what I would recommend is watching this part one and part two. Okay. But yeah so like in the past we've had some interns that wanted to engineer themselves into working at. One of our customers places, so you did a lot of projects that were pertaining to finance of fraud, and so, you know as as an intern he created all these different Open Source projects blogs and videos and then he. Basically, went to the hiring manager at this this bank and said. They were there recruiting actively at the time and said yeah i'd love to work with you and and then they said yeah we really want you, and then he was negotiating his salary as an intern to basically double his salary. Because he had all the proof it wasn't like he said Oh, I worked on paragraph on his resume it was literally like. Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam so you know he engineered himself into that that kind of position but that's what you could do as well, so like if you wanted to. work at tesla or work at wherever How would you engineer yourself into to be in that position, and you might need somebody that can help guide you or be a mentor as well. yeah I think that's an interesting concept, just like with the engineering yourself that you can it's not like you can just start off with nothing and still just do different things to build yourself up in that way. yeah yeah you just you just ask yourself, you try to figure out like where where you can. provide the most like, how can you how can you demonstrate that you can provide value in that perspective space that you want to be in. And then it's all about building up that and then driving that awareness so like maybe hopefully it maybe they even reach out because they see that you became an influencer in that space, because you were doing a bunch of. a bunch of things along that journey to build that influence, maybe. I don't know bank people go to a specific meetup and there you know you start to go and short hair stuff there and. This VP of this executive bank is at that meetup and they saw your presentation, they want to give you a job now so it's just about putting yourself out there and engineering yourself and different positions. cool. Do you guys have any other questions. yeah. i'm Danny and I was wondering like you keep saying. How do I, like. Well, what makes you have to you have to ask yourself what makes you passionate you know what what what excites you what kind of things. are of interest to you so like let's say I love to play virtual reality, I like to do virtual out of games, or something like that. You know, and I want to be a virtual I like I want to work at oculus you know how can I engineer my projects and different things. and add a unique perspective that maybe they're not thinking about and then, how do I get in front of that community so when you want to like. So if I was doing vr ar I might do some different hackathons and then I might share what I did, and then tag oculus and stuff and then go to their community and share it try to find key influencers maybe even my local area. Even even been to the point where i'm going to be like I find somebody at oculus that lives in Minnesota and I connect with them on linkedin and say hey i'd love to go and grab a cup of coffee, you know, so you can you can you can do all these. Active things not and and try to build that up versus being like Oh, I always wanted to work at oculus go through school and then you. And then you got like oh I got my resume here you go and they'd be like I don't care about you, I don't know who you are you're just another resume like, how do you how do you not be that so like I guarantee you if, like. If you wanted to work at tiger, if you want to work at whatever company if you're doing all those different things they're going to be taking notice. It wasn't me who offered a job, to share it was our CEO and our CEO is like look at this person creating all this stuff because she was sharing all this. cool things on linkedin social media was in the forums, creating all these different things doing hackathons Vance that the the CEO said hey, we need to hire this person I said. All right, let's do it, you know and so she got a job right so that's that's what you need to do is is think through that and they don't teach you at that school, at least not the school, I went to. You did the vr game. But I don't really have like a vr. want to do something. What I said just if you don't know what you want to do yeah. um so one thing I would do is maybe start to explore like a kid so let's go back to oculus I have no idea anything about their Community so i'm just making all this stuff up. I will start to get like a deep dive into their Community what's resonating what are some like new product. Maybe even not start to think of like what are their new product releases and might, might I might start targeting like. Building a how to video with this new feature that they just released because that's always going to be hot like they're trying to get out the new features. And then i'd start to get my presence known and then I would start to just explore different things and come up with unique things in that space so maybe like Okay, how do you do, even if you wanted to combine air and graph, how do you do like. So we're talking to unity, right now, and how do we do, how do you do analytics on all the actions and behaviors and. People and users and stuff like that all that data is stored into a big graph and then you can run all the analytics that you went on to it so maybe you do something unique like that I do include vr. Video games with with analytics are you know you have to you have to just try to like feel it out go to you have to first go out there and try to explore. And then see where what what interests you or what what yeah but but a good way, though, is is if there's new features that come out and you start being the first one to shirt like share how to do stuff with those features that company is going to take notice, you know. that's that's one thing you could do. huh. yeah yeah I mean you have to really put your put yourself out there, since not asking simple in the way i've always given yeah. always be like give give give give and people are going to start taking notice of it but you're given like strategic like you have a reason why you're doing it. Thank you yeah. Any last minute questions. would be are correct. me. No, I don't work at a vr company I work at a graph database company. name is here. Oh, I was just giving I was just gonna example, so we were talking about how to engineer yourself and I just took a random a random company and was walking through how I would engineer myself and if I was going after that perspective john or role or company I got confused for a second. Sorry. I just heard that example. You could do that for any example, though. The big bank healthcare company, you know just engineer yourself doing strategic things to put your put yourself out there and getting visibility. Oh, I have like I kind of have an interesting question, what do you think, or what do you think are the next like big upcoming technologies that you feel I don't feel like are still pretty new but there they have like a huge potential to just. expanded become like pop things in CS. See yes um well. yeah they I mean quantum is definitely like the fringe of possible and impossible I think they know if they can never figure out quantum to work at scale. That would be a pretty interesting, one that would have ripple effects across many industries, you know what if you had quantum processors for cryptocurrency or quantum whatever processors for math equations and everybody can have those at home. Oh, one of the I guess it's not really a technology but it's an interesting it's an interesting thought exercises. there's a I don't know the exact number, but like billions at least a billion, I think, or more of people don't have Internet right now right there's just not the infrastructure, the network. spacex is coming out my parents have spacex at their house, so they just meld know are shooting up to sound like a 200 megs. Now if everyone has Internet, what are the, what are the, what are the conversations of that how am I market shifts happen that might be. That might be an interesting exercise but yeah graph that everyone's looking for different ways to do analytics in the grass face graph neural nets are getting pretty popular dnn. there's all there's every day there's a new gbt three new you know new language models and stuff like that, so one shot learning language models, I think there's always going to be a need for analytics. there's not enough data graph data scientist that's a short ever there's a lot of Python developers, but you know people that know know how to do these. Different data structures um yeah I would say. I would say. Another one would be. Digital twin is sort of a weird one in the sense that they're trying to. Do predictions about different things based off of other things, and so, if you look up digital trend twin you might find a lot of different things, but digital twin in the sense of users user applications, so that could be into recommendation engines. Digital twins in the sense of like medical means, how can you how can you find somebody that's super similar to yourself and then. You can make that better drug recommendations or you can run different analytics. But yeah blockchain technology is still have a long ways to go they're pretty pretty new. Then. there's a there's there's a lot of different ones, I would just I would, if I was you i'd follow gartner. The emerging trends and that changes every so that's when we were working at this emerging tech working on quantum Ai de de de de de we're following the gartner emerging trends so look up that it's called the hype cycle and i'll show you all the new things on the cusp of possibilities. Oh Okay, I never heard of that. yeah right chicken up. like this. yeah gartner and look at here i'll just share it. So this is this where I would go to like. So it looks like. This thing. So these are the emerging technologies. Oh, and F tease Ai driven augmentation quantum machine learning. So we can go back and see what the previous ones where it's a little hard to see carbon based trends transitions bring your own identity as citizen point digital twin here's digital twin they're talking about that. yeah so you can you can start to see data fabrics. The gardener has a lot of great information 2009 they're talking about five g still. But this is a great place to to look at the cusp of nascar 3D printing. flying a time as cars say that's more than 10 years from now. Low earth orbit satellites systems there, we do not the spacex so it was that one five years, I think that that that emerged a little bit. earlier. So yeah that's what I would look at and follow those reports partners really good at submitting those on what's what's new. Are you still working on that jarvis thing. I haven't I haven't for a while, actually, it was talking to a university that they wanted to incorporate graph and virtual reality like to walk through like the Meta. an. And I was suggested doing the jarvis project with them, but I haven't had enough resources to actually build my own jarvis type project, because the ultimate goal would be like, just as you were talking to jarvis. You could use alexa and then maybe some like virtual reality on mentation who like walk through information and stuff. Just never had the chance to to to focus on it so but, hopefully, hopefully, I can propose this idea to this university I think it's an Ohio. That they'll have a bunch of students that could work on building something along that lines because and will just help guide them mentor them along MySpace because that's what she wants to do something vr with graph so that was pretty cool. Any other any other questions. guys any questions audience. No, I think we're good. yeah thanks for thanks for coming here and spending the time just talk about those then provide your your thoughts and insights on things. yeah yeah and feel free to Ping me on discord if you want like hey. i'm thinking about doing this, could you have do you have any advice, how to approach that. You know, or if you have a dream job and you want us to somebody else to drift off of how you can successfully get yourself in there, let me know more than willing to to help coach or mentor. Oh, I actually had a question, so I was thinking about doing like a graph database it's like trying to model like something about students like sleep better or something. But I wasn't really sure how to go about that, but I was just thinking like for like I don't know how I would like collect data or anything like that, so I wanted to ask you, like how, how do you like get data for like these kind of projects. yeah sometimes on kaggle we've done fitbit data with tiger graph at my previous company adopt them and basically we just asked everyone to share their fitbit data, just like you would share your linkedin data. And so we did a data dump of their their data. That my coworker is actually the primary. The my coworkers the primary driver of that that initiative and that product, so if that's something that really interests you i'll tell them to to to chat with you, and he can tell you all about how to structure it up for fitbit data. yeah. I don't think there's many blogs on that either So if you create some can share it with everybody. right for like fitbit data yeah I haven't I haven't seen I he created an iot you create an iot graph on if you go to YouTube and then go to tie graph and then look up iot I think there's some iot based stuff he created. And, but it was it was more arm, you know, like whether or is more like temperature and humidity sensing but I mean the same concept, you know streaming data. yeah. yeah I think all. Right, thank you. All right, it's good to see you guys. "
